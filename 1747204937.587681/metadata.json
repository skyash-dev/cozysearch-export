  "dek": "A replication crisis in psychology studies published in _Nature_ and _Science_ revealed that many findings couldn't be reproduced. However, prediction markets and simple peer surveys accurately predicted which studies would replicate, suggesting that identifying flawed research is easier than it seems.
