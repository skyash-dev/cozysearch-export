> In the manga _Death Note_, the pro­tag­o­nist Light Yagami is given the su­per­nat­ural weapon “Death Note” which can kill any­one on de­mand, and be­gins using it to re­shape the world. The ge­nius de­tec­tive L at­tempts to track him down with analy­sis and trick­ery, and ul­ti­mately suc­ceeds. _Death Note_ is al­most a thought- experiment-given the per­fect mur­der weapon, how can you screw up any­way? I con­sider the var­i­ous steps of L’s process from the per­spec­tive of com­puter se­cu­rity, cryp­tog­ra­phy, and in­for­ma­tion the­ory, to quan­tify Light’s ini­tial anonymity and how L grad­u­ally de- anonymizes him, and con­sider which mis­take was the largest as fol­lows:

If you are un­fa­mil­iar with DN, see my [_Death Note_ End­ing ⁠](https://gwern.net/death-note-ending) essay or con­sult [Wikipedia ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note#Plot) or [⁠read the DN rules ⁠](https://deathnote.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note).)

I have called the pro­tag­o­nist of _Death Note_, Light Yagami, “hubris­tic” and said he made big mis­takes. So I ought to ex­plain what he did wrong and how he could do bet­ter.

While Light starts schem­ing and tak­ing se­ri­ous risks as early as the ar­rival of the FBI team in Japan, he has fun­da­men­tally al­ready screwed up. L should never have got­ten that close to Light. The Death Note kills flaw­lessly with­out foren­sic trace and over ar­bi­trary dis­tances; _Death Note_ is al­most a thought- experiment—given the _per­fect_ mur­der weapon, how can you screw up _any­way_?

Some of the other Death Note users high­light the prob­lem. The user in the [Yot­suba Group ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Death_Note_characters#Yotsuba_Group) car­ries out the nor­mal ex­e­cu­tions, but _also_ kills a num­ber of promi­nent com­peti­tors. The killings di­rectly point to the Yot­suba Group and even­tu­ally the user’s death. The moral of the story is that in­di­rect re­la­tion­ships can be fatal in nar­row­ing down the pos­si­bil­i­ties from ‘every­one’ to ‘these 8 men’.

## Detective Stories As Optimization Problems

In Light’s case, L starts with the world’s en­tire pop­u­la­tion of 7 bil­lion peo­ple and needs to nar­row it down to 1 per­son. It’s a search prob­lem. It maps fairly di­rectly onto basic [in­for­ma­tion the­ory ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory), in fact. (See also [Sim­u­la­tion in­fer­ences ⁠](https://gwern.net/simulation-inference), [The 3 Grenades ⁠](https://gwern.net/3-grenades), and for case stud­ies in ap­plied deanonymiza­tion, [Tor DNM- related ar­rests, 2011 – 4 2015 ⁠](https://gwern.net/dnm-arrest).) To uniquely spec­ify one item out of 7 bil­lion, you need 33 bits of in­for­ma­tion be­cause log 2 (7000000000) ≈ 32.7; to use an anal­ogy, your 32-bit com­puter can only ad­dress one unique lo­ca­tion in mem­ory out of _4_ bil­lion lo­ca­tions, and adding an­other bit dou­bles the ca­pac­ity to >8 bil­lion. Is 33 bits of in­for­ma­tion a lot?

Not re­ally. L could get one bit just by look­ing at his­tory or crime sta­tis­tics, and not­ing that mass mur­der­ers are, to an as­ton­ish­ing de­gree, _male_ ⁠ [1](#fn:1), thereby rul­ing out half the world pop­u­la­tion and ac­tu­ally start­ing L off with a re­quire­ment to ob­tain only 32 bits to break Light’s anonymity.⁠ [2](#fn:2) If Death Note users were suf­fi­ciently ra­tio­nal & knowl­edge­able, they could draw on con­cepts like [su­per­ra­tional­ity ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality) to acausally co­op­er­ate⁠ [3](#fn:3) to avoid this in­for­ma­tion leak­age… by ar­rang­ing to pass on Death Notes to fe­males⁠ [4](#fn:4) to re­store a 50:50 gen­der ratio—for ex­am­ple, if for every fe­male who ob­tained a Death note there were 3 males with Death Notes, then all users could roll a 1d3 dice and if 1 keep it and if 2 or 3 pass it on to some­one of the op­po­site gen­der.

We should first point out that Light is al­ways going to leak _some_ bits. The only way he could re­main per­fectly hid­den is to not use the Death Note at all. If you change the world in even the slight­est way, then you have leaked in­for­ma­tion about your­self in prin­ci­ple. Every­thing is con­nected in some sense; you can­not mag­i­cally wave away the ex­is­tence of fire with­out cre­at­ing a cas­cade of con­se­quences that re­sult in [⁠every liv­ing thing dying ⁠](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LaM5aTcXvXzwQSC2Q/universal-fire). For ex­am­ple, the fun­da­men­tal point of Light ex­e­cut­ing crim­i­nals is to _shorten their lifes­pan_ —there’s no way to hide that. You can’t both shorten their lives and _not_ shorten their lives. He is going to re­veal him­self this way, at the least, to the ac­tu­ar­ies and sta­tis­ti­cians.

More his­tor­i­cally, this has been a chal­lenge for cryp­tog­ra­phers, like in WWII: how did they ex­ploit the Enigma & other com­mu­ni­ca­tions with­out re­veal­ing they had done so? Their so­lu­tion was mis­di­rec­tion: [con­stantly ar­rang­ing for plau­si­ble al­ter­na­tives ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_\(cryptography\)#Safeguarding_of_sources), like search planes that ‘just hap­pened’ to find Ger­man sub­marines or leaks to [con­trolled known Ger­man agents ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-Cross_System) about there being undis­cov­ered spies. (How­ever, the fa­mous story that Win­ston Churchill al­lowed the town of Coven­try to be bombed rather than risk the se­cret of Ultra has [since been put into ques­tion ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Blitz#Coventry_and_Ultra).) This worked in part be­cause of Ger­man over­con­fi­dence, be­cause the war did not last too long, and in part be­cause each cover story was plau­si­ble on its own and no one was, in the chaos of war, able to see the whole pic­ture and re­al­ize that there were _too_ many lucky search planes and too many undis­cov­er­able moles; even­tu­ally, how­ever, some­one would re­al­ize, and ap­par­ently some Ger­mans did con­clude that Enigma had to have been bro­ken (but much too late). It’s not clear to me what would be the best mis­di­rec­tion for Light to mask his nor­mal killings—use the Death Note’s con­trol fea­tures to in­vent an anti- criminal ter­ror­ist or­ga­ni­za­tion?

So there is a real chal­lenge here: one party is try­ing to infer as much as pos­si­ble from ob­served ef­fects, and the other is try­ing to min­i­mize how much the for­mer can ob­serve while not stop­ping en­tirely. How well does Light bal­ance the com­pet­ing de­mands?

## Mistakes

## Mistake 1

How­ever, he can try to re­duce the leak­age and make his [anonymity set ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_anonymity) as large as pos­si­ble. For ex­am­ple, killing every crim­i­nal with a heart at­tack is a dead give- away. Crim­i­nals do not die of heart at­tacks that often. (The point is more dra­matic if you re­place ‘heart at­tack’ with ‘lupus’; as we all know, in real life it’s never lupus.) Heart at­tacks are a sub­set of all deaths, and by re­strict­ing him­self, Light makes it eas­ier to de­tect his ac­tiv­i­ties. 1,000 deaths of lupus are a blar­ing red alarm; 1,000 deaths of heart at­tacks are an odd­ity; and 1,000 deaths dis­trib­uted over the sta­tis­ti­cally likely sus­pects of can­cer and heart dis­ease etc. are al­most in­vis­i­ble (but still no­tice­able in prin­ci­ple).

So, Light’s fun­da­men­tal mis­take is to kill in ways un­re­lated to his goal. Killing through heart at­tacks does not just make him vis­i­ble early on, but the deaths re­veals that his as­sas­si­na­tion method is su­per­nat­u­rally pre­cise. L has been tipped off that Kira ex­ists. What­ever the bogus jus­ti­fi­ca­tion may be, this is a major vic­tory for his op­po­nents.

First mis­take, and a clas­sic one of se­r­ial killers (eg. the [BTK killer’s ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rader) vaunt­ing was less anony­mous than he be­lieved): delu­sions of grandeur and the de­sire to taunt, play with, and con­trol their vic­tims and demon­strate their power over the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion. From a lit­er­ary per­spec­tive, this sim­i­lar­ity is clearly not an ac­ci­dent, as we are meant to read Light as the [So­ciopath ⁠](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath) [Hero ⁠](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero) ar­che­type (akin to [Grand Ad­mi­ral Thrawn ⁠](https://gwern.net/note/note#the-tragedy-of-grand-admiral-thrawn)): his ul­ti­mate down­fall is the con­se­quence of his [fatal per­son­al­ity flaw ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartia), [hubris ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris), par­tic­u­larly in the orig­i­nal [sadis­tic ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadistic_personality_disorder) sense. Light _can­not_ help but self- sabotage like this.

(This is also deeply prob­lem­atic from the point of car­ry­ing out Light’s the­ory of de­ter­rence: to deter crim­i­nals and vil­lains, it is not nec­es­sary for there to be a globally- known sin­gle su­per­nat­ural killer, when it would be equally ef­fec­tive to arrange for all the killings to be done nat­u­ral­is­ti­cally by third par­ties/ po­lice/ ju­di­ciary or used in­di­rectly to crack cases. Ar­guably the de­ter­rence would be more ef­fec­tive the more dif­fused it’s be­lieved to be—since a sin­gle killer has a fi­nite lifes­pan, fi­nite knowl­edge, fal­li­bil­ity, and idio­syn­cratic pref­er­ences which re­duce the threat and con­nec­tion to crim­i­nal­ity, while if all the deaths were as­cribed to un­usu­ally ef­fec­tive po­lice or de­tec­tives, this would be in­ferred as a gen­eral in­crease in all kinds of po­lice com­pe­tence, one which will not in­stantly dis­ap­pear when one per­son gets bored or hit by a bus.)

## Mistake 2

Worse, the deaths are non- random in other ways—they tend to occur at par­tic­u­lar times! Graphed, daily pat­terns jump out.

L was able to nar­row down the ac­tive times of the pre­sum­able stu­dent or worker to a par­tic­u­lar range of lon­gi­tude, say 125–150° out of 180°; and what coun­try is most promi­nent in that range? Japan. So that cut down the 7 bil­lion peo­ple to around 0.128 bil­lion; 0.128 bil­lion re­quires 27 bits (log 2 (128000000) ≈ 26.93) so just the sched­ul­ing of deaths cost Light 6 bits of anonymity!

### De-Anonymization

On a side- note, some might be skep­ti­cal that one can infer much of any­thing from the graph and that _Death Note_ was just gloss­ing over this part. “How can any­one infer that it was some­one liv­ing in Japan just from 2 clumpy lines at morn­ing and evening in Japan?” But ac­tu­ally, such a graph is sur­pris­ingly pre­cise. I learned this years be­fore I watched _Death Note_, when I was heav­ily ac­tive on Wikipedia; often I would won­der if two ed­i­tors were the same per­son or roughly where an ed­i­tor lived. What I would do if their edits or user page did not re­veal any­thing use­ful is I would go to “Kate’s [edit counter ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_edit_counters) ” and I would ex­am­ine the times of day all their hun­dreds or thou­sands of edits were made at. Typ­i­cally, what one would see was ~4 hours where there were no edits what­so­ever, then ~4 hours with mod­er­ate to high ac­tiv­ity, a trough, then an­other grad­ual rise to 8 hours later and a fur­ther de­cline down to the first 4 hours of no ac­tiv­ity. These pe­ri­ods quite clearly cor­re­sponded to sleep (pretty much every­one is asleep at 4 AM), morn­ing, lunch & work hours, evening, and then night with peo­ple oc­ca­sion­ally stay­ing up late and edit­ing⁠ [5](#fn:5). There was noise, of course, from peo­ple stay­ing up es­pe­cially late or get­ting in a bunch of edit­ing dur­ing their work­day or oc­ca­sion­ally trav­el­ing, but the over­all pat­terns were clear—never did I dis­cover that some­one was ac­tu­ally a night­watch­man and my guess was an en­tire hemi­sphere off. (Aca­d­e­mic es­ti­mates based on user edit­ing pat­terns cor­re­late well with what is pre­dicted by on the basis of the ge­og­ra­phy of IP edits.⁠ [6](#fn:6))

## Mistake 3

Light’s third mis­take was re­act­ing to the [ca­nary trap ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_trap) provo­ca­tion of the Lind L. Tai­lor broad­cast, crit­i­ciz­ing Kira, and Light lash­ing out to use the clearly- visible name & face to kill Lind L. Tai­lor. The live broad­cast was a bla­tant at­tempt to pro­voke a re­ac­tion—any re­ac­tion—from a sur­prised & un­pre­pared Light, and that alone should have been suf­fi­cient rea­son to sim­ply ig­nore it (even if Light could not have rea­son­ably known ex­actly _how_ it was a trap): one should never do what an enemy wants one to do on ground & terms & tim­ing pre­pared by the enemy. (Light had the op­tion to use the Death Note at any time in the fu­ture, and that would have been al­most as good a demon­stra­tion of his power as doing so dur­ing a live broad­cast.)

Run­ning the broad­cast in 1 re­gion was also a gam­ble & a po­ten­tial mis­take on L’s part; he had no real rea­son to think Light was in [Kanto ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region) (or if he did al­ready have [pri­ors ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability) / in­for­ma­tion to that ef­fect, he should’ve been bi­sect­ing Kanto) and should have arranged for it to be broad­cast to ex­actly half of Japan’s pop­u­la­tion, ob­tain­ing an ex­pected max­i­mum of 1 bit. But it was one that paid off; he nar­rowed his tar­get down to 1⁄3 the orig­i­nal Japan­ese pop­u­la­tion, for a gain of ~1.6 bits. (You can see it was a gam­ble by con­sid­er­ing if Light had been out­side Kanto; since he would not see it live, he would not have re­acted, and all L would learn is that his sus­pect was in that other 2⁄3 of the pop­u­la­tion, for a gain of only ~0.3 bits.)

But even this wasn’t a _huge_ mis­take. He lost 6 bits to his sched­ule of killing, and lost an­other 1.6 bits to tem­pera­men­tally killing Lind L. Tai­lor, but since the male pop­u­la­tion of Kanto is 21.5 mil­lion (43 mil­lion total), he still has ~24 bits of anonymity left (log 2 (21500000) ≈ 24.36). That’s not too ter­ri­ble, and the loss is mit­i­gated even fur­ther by other de­tails of this mis­take, as pointed out by [⁠Zm­flav­ius](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/victoria.10/); specif­i­cally, that un­like “being male” or “being Japan­ese”, the in­for­ma­tion about being in Kanto is sub­ject to _decay_, since peo­ple move around all the time for all sorts of rea­sons:

> …quite pos­si­bly Light’s biggest mis­take was in­ad­ver­tently re­veal­ing his con­nec­tion to the po­lice hi­er­ar­chy by hack­ing his dad’s com­puter. Whereas even the Lind L. Tay­lor de­ba­cle only re­vealed his killing me­chan­ics and nar­rowed him down to “some­one in the Kanto re­gion” (which is, while an im­pres­sive ac­com­plish­ment based on the in­for­ma­tion he had, en­tirely mean­ing­less for ac­tu­ally find­ing a sus­pect), there were per­haps a few hun­dred peo­ple who had ac­cess to the in­for­ma­tion Light’s dad had. There’s also the fact that L _knew_ that Light was prob­a­bly some­one in their late teens, mean­ing that there was an ex­tremely high chance that at the end of the school year, even that coup of his would ex­pire, thanks to stu­dents head­ing off to uni­ver­sity all over Japan (of course, Light went to [Toudai ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tokyo), and a stu­dent of his cal­iber not at­tend­ing such a uni­ver­sity would be sus­pi­cious, but L had no way of know­ing that then). I mean, per­haps L had hoped that Kira would re­veal him­self by sud­denly mov­ing away from the Kanto re­gion, but come the next May, he would have no way of mon­i­tor­ing un­usual move­ments among late teenagers, be­cause a large per­cent­age of them would be mov­ing for le­git­i­mate rea­sons.

(One could still run the in­fer­ence “back­wards” on any par­tic­u­lar per­son to ver­ify they were in Kanto in the right time pe­riod, but as time passes, it be­comes less pos­si­ble to run the in­fer­ence “for­wards” and only ex­am­ine peo­ple in Kanto.)

This mis­take also shows us that the im­por­tant thing that in­for­ma­tion the­ory buys us, re­ally, is not the _bit_ (we could be using log 10 rather than log 2, and com­pares [“dits” ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartley_\(unit\)) rather than “bits”) so much as com­par­ing events in the plot on a _log­a­rith­mic_ scale. If we sim­ply looked at how the ab­solute num­ber of how many peo­ple were ruled out at each step, we’d con­clude that the first mis­take by Light was a de­ba­cle with­out com­pare since it let L rule out >6 bil­lion peo­ple, ap­prox­i­mately 60× more peo­ple than all the other mis­takes put to­gether would let L rule out. Mis­takes are rel­a­tive to each other, not ab­solutes.

## Mistake 4

Light’s fourth mis­take was to use con­fi­den­tial po­lice in­for­ma­tion stolen using his po­lice­man fa­ther’s cre­den­tials. This was un­nec­es­sary as there are count­less crim­i­nals he could still ex­e­cute using pub­lic in­for­ma­tion (face+name is not typ­i­cally dif­fi­cult to get), and if for some rea­son he needed a spe­cific crim­i­nal, he could ei­ther re­strict use of se­cret in­for­ma­tion to a few high- priority vic­tims—if only to avoid sus­pi­cions of hack­ing & sub­se­quent se­cu­rity up­grades cost­ing him ac­cess!—or man­u­fac­ture, using the Death Note’s co­er­cive pow­ers or Kira’s pub­lic sup­port, a way to re­lease in­for­ma­tion such as a ‘leak’ or pass­ing pub­lic trans­parency laws.

This mis­take was the largest in bits lost. But in­ter­est­ingly, many or even most _Death Note_ fans do not seem to re­gard this as his largest mis­take, in­stead point­ing to his killing Lind L. Tai­lor or per­haps re­ly­ing too much on Mikami. The in­for­ma­tion the­o­ret­i­cal per­spec­tive strongly dis­agrees, and lets us quan­tify how large this mis­take was.

When he acts on the se­cret po­lice in­for­ma­tion, he in­stantly cuts down his pos­si­ble iden­tity to one out of a few thou­sand peo­ple con­nected to the po­lice. Let’s be gen­er­ous and say 10,000. It takes 14 bits to spec­ify 1 per­son out of 10,000 (log 2 (1,0000) ≈ 13.29)—as com­pared to the 24–25 bits to spec­ify a Kanto dweller.

This mis­take cost him 11 bits of anonymity; in other words, this mis­take cost him _twice_ what his sched­ul­ing cost him and al­most _8_ times the mur­der of Tai­lor!

## Mistake 5

In com­par­i­son, the fifth mis­take, mur­der­ing Ray Pen­bar’s fi­ancee and fo­cus­ing L’s sus­pi­cion on Pen­bar’s as­signed tar­gets was pos­i­tively cheap. If we as­sume Pen­bar was tasked 200 leads out of the 10,000, then mur­der­ing him and the fi­ancee dropped Light from 14 bits to 8 bits (log 2 (200) ≈ 7.64) or just 6 bits or a lit­tle over half the fourth mis­take and com­pa­ra­ble to the orig­i­nal sched­ul­ing mis­take.

## Endgame

At this point in the plot, L re­sorts to di­rect mea­sures and en­ters Light’s life di­rectly, en­rolling at the uni­ver­sity. From this point on, Light is screwed as he is now play­ing a deadly game of [Mafia ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_\(party_game\)) with L & the in­ves­tiga­tive team. He frit­tered away >25 bits of anonymity and then L in­tu­ited the rest and sus­pected him all along. (We could jus­tify L skip­ping over the re­main­ing 8 bits by point­ing out that L can an­a­lyze the deaths and infer psy­cho­log­i­cal char­ac­ter­is­tics like ar­ro­gance, puzzle- solving, and great in­tel­li­gence, which com­bined with heuris­ti­cally search­ing the re­main­ing can­di­dates, could lead him to zero in on Light.)

From the the­o­ret­i­cal point of view, the game was over at that point. The chal­lenge for L then be­came prov­ing it to L’s sat­is­fac­tion under his self- imposed moral con­straints.⁠ [19](#fn:19)

## Security Is Hard (Let’s Go Shopping)

What _should_ Light have done? That’s easy to an­swer, but tricky to im­ple­ment.

One could try to man­u­fac­ture _dis_ in­for­ma­tion. [Ter­ence Tao ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao) re­hearses many of the above points about in­for­ma­tion the­ory & anonymity, and [⁠goes on to loosely dis­cuss ⁠](https://gwern.net/doc/cs/security/2012-terencetao-anonymity.html) the pos­si­ble ben­e­fits of [fak­ing in­for­ma­tion ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation):

> …one ad­di­tional way to gain more anonymity is through de­lib­er­ate _dis­in­for­ma­tion_. For in­stance, sup­pose that one re­veals 100 in­de­pen­dent bits of in­for­ma­tion about one­self. Or­di­nar­ily, this would cost 100 bits of anonymity (as­sum­ing that each bit was _a pri­ori_ equally likely to be true or false), by cut­ting the num­ber of pos­si­bil­i­ties down by a fac­tor of 2 100; but if 5 of these 100 bits (cho­sen ran­domly and not re­vealed in ad­vance) are de­lib­er­ately fal­si­fied, then the num­ber of pos­si­bil­i­ties in­creases again by a fac­tor of (100 `choose` 5) ~ 2 26, re­cov­er­ing about 26 bits of anonymity. In prac­tice one gains even more anonymity than this, be­cause to dis­pel the dis­in­for­ma­tion one needs to solve a [sat­is­fi­a­bil­ity ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability) prob­lem, which can be no­to­ri­ously in­tractable com­pu­ta­tion­ally, al­though this ad­di­tional pro­tec­tion may dis­si­pate with time as al­go­rithms im­prove (eg. by in­cor­po­rat­ing ideas from [com­pressed sens­ing ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing)).

## Randomizing

The dif­fi­culty with sug­gest­ing that Light should—or _could_ —have used dis­in­for­ma­tion on the tim­ing of deaths is that we are, in ef­fect, en­gag­ing in a sort of [hind­sight bias ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias).

How ex­actly is Light or any­one sup­posed to know that L could de­duce his time­zone from his killings? I men­tioned an ex­am­ple of using Wikipedia edits to lo­cal­ize ed­i­tors, but that tech­nique was unique to me among WP ed­i­tors⁠ [20](#fn:20) and no doubt there are many other forms of in­for­ma­tion leak­age I have never heard of de­spite com­pil­ing a list; if I were Light, even if I re­mem­bered my Wikipedia tech­nique, I might not bother evenly dis­trib­ut­ing my killing over the clock or adopt­ing a de­cep­tive pat­tern (eg. sug­gest­ing I was in Eu­rope rather than Japan).

If Light had known he was leak­ing tim­ing in­for­ma­tion but didn’t know that some­one out there was clever enough to use it (a “known un­known”), then we might blame him; but how is Light sup­posed to know these “un­known un­knowns”?

[Ran­dom­iza­tion ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization) is the an­swer. Ran­dom­iza­tion and en­cryp­tion scram­ble the cor­re­la­tions be­tween input and out­put, and they would serve as well in _Death Note_ as they do in cryp­tog­ra­phy & sta­tis­tics in the real world, at the cost of some ef­fi­ciency. The point of ran­dom­iza­tion, both in cryp­tog­ra­phy and in sta­tis­ti­cal ex­per­i­ments, is to not just pre­vent the leaked in­for­ma­tion or [con­founders ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding) (re­spec­tively) you do know about but also the ones you do _not_ yet know about.

To steal & para­phrase an ex­am­ple from [Jim Manzi’s ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Manzi_\(software_entrepreneur\)) [_Un­con­trolled_ ⁠](https://www.amazon.com/Uncontrolled-Surprising-Trial---Error-Business/dp/046502324X/): you’re run­ning a weight- loss ex­per­i­ment. You know that the ef­fec­tive­ness might vary with each sub­ject’s pre- existing weight, but you don’t be­lieve in ran­dom­iza­tion (you’re a prac­ti­cal man! only prissy sta­tis­ti­cians worry about ran­dom­iza­tion!); so you split the sub­jects by weight, and for con­ve­nience you al­lo­cate them by when they show up to your ex­per­i­ment—in the end, there are ex­actly 10 ex­per­i­men­tal sub­jects over 150 pounds and 10 con­trols over 150 pounds, and so on and so forth. Un­for­tu­nately, it turns out that un­be­knownst to you, a ge­netic vari­ant con­trols weight gain and a whole ex­tended fam­ily showed up at your ex­per­i­ment early on and they all got al­lo­cated to ‘ex­per­i­men­tal’ and none of them to ‘con­trol’ (since you didn’t need to ran­dom­ize, right? you were mak­ing sure the groups were matched on weight!). Your ex­per­i­ment is now bogus and mis­lead­ing. Of course, you could run a sec­ond ex­per­i­ment where you make sure the ex­per­i­men­tal and con­trol groups are matched on weight and also now matched on that ge­netic vari­ant… but now there’s the po­ten­tial for some _third_ con­founder to hit you. If only you had used ran­dom­iza­tion—then you would prob­a­bly have put some of the vari­ants into the other group as well and your re­sults wouldn’t’ve been bogus!

So to deal with Light’s first mis­take, sim­ply sched­ul­ing every death on the hour will not work be­cause the wake- sleep cycle is still present. If he set up a list and wrote down _n_ crim­i­nals for each hour to elim­i­nate the peak- troughs rather than ran­dom­iz­ing, could that still go wrong? Maybe: we don’t know what in­for­ma­tion might be left in the data which an L or Tur­ing could de­ci­pher. I can spec­u­late about one pos­si­bil­ity—the al­lo­ca­tion of each kind of crim­i­nal to each hour. If one were to draw up lists and go in order (hey, one doesn’t need ran­dom­iza­tion, right?), then the order might go ‘crim­i­nals in the morn­ing news­pa­per, crim­i­nals on TV, crim­i­nals whose de­tails were not im­me­di­ately given but were avail­able on­line, crim­i­nals from years ago, his­tor­i­cal crim­i­nals etc’; if the morning- newspaper-criminals start at say 6 AM Japan time… And al­lo­cat­ing evenly might be hard, since there’s nat­u­rally going to be short­falls when there just aren’t many crim­i­nals that day or the news­pa­pers aren’t pub­lish­ing (hol­i­days?) etc., so the short­fall pe­ri­ods will pin­point what the Kira con­sid­ers ‘end of the day’.

A much safer pro­ce­dure is thorough- going ran­dom­iza­tion ap­plied to tim­ing, sub­jects, and man­ner of death. Even if we as­sume that Light was bound and de­ter­mined to re­veal the ex­is­tence of Kira and gain pub­lic­ity and in­ter­na­tional no­to­ri­ety (a major char­ac­ter flaw in its own right; ac­com­plish­ing things, tak­ing credit—choose one), he still did not have to re­duce his anonymity much past 32 bits.

1.  Each ex­e­cu­tion’s time could be de­ter­mined by a ran­dom dice roll (say, a 24- sided dice for hours and a 60- sided dice for min­utes).
    
2.  Se­lect­ing method of death could be done sim­i­larly based on eas­ily re­searched de­mo­graphic data, al­though per­haps ir­rel­e­vant (serv­ing mostly to con­ceal that a killing has taken place).
    
3.  Se­lect­ing crim­i­nals could be based on in­ter­na­tion­ally ac­ces­si­ble pe­ri­od­i­cals that plau­si­bly every human has ac­cess to, such as the _New York Times_, and deaths could be de­layed by months or years to broaden the pos­si­bil­i­ties as to where the Kira learned of the vic­tim (TV? books? the In­ter­net?) and avoid­ing is­sues like killing a crim­i­nal only pub­li­cized on one ob­scure Japan­ese pub­lic tele­vi­sion chan­nel. And so on.
    

Let’s re­mem­ber that all this is pred­i­cated on anonymity, and on Light using low- tech strate­gies; as one per­son asked me, “why doesn’t Light set up an cryp­to­graphic [as­sas­si­na­tion mar­ket ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market) or just take over the world? He would win with­out all this clev­er­ness.” Well, then it would not be _Death Note_.

## Communicating With a Death Note

One might won­der how much in­for­ma­tion one could send _in­ten­tion­ally_ with a Death Note, as op­posed to in­ad­ver­tently leak bits about one’s iden­tity. As deaths are by and large pub­licly known in­for­ma­tion, we’ll as­sume the sender and re­cip­i­ent have some sort of pre- arranged key or one- time pad (al­though one would won­der why they’d use such an im­moral and clumsy sys­tem as op­posed to steganog­ra­phy or mes­sages on­line).

A death in­flicted by a Death Note has 3 main dis­tin­guish­ing traits which one can con­trol—who, when, and how:

1.  the **per­son**
    
    The ‘who?’ is al­ready cal­cu­lated for us: if it takes 33 bits to spec­ify a unique human, then a par­tic­u­lar human can con­vey 33 bits. Con­cerns about learn­abil­ity (how would you learn of an Ama­zon tribesman’s death?) imply that it’s re­ally <33 bits.
    
    If you try some scheme to en­code more bits into the choice of as­sas­si­na­tion, you ei­ther wind up with 33 bits or you wind up un­able to con­vey cer­tain com­bi­na­tions of bits and ef­fec­tively 33 bits any­way—your scheme will tell you that to con­vey your des­per­ately im­por­tant mes­sage _X_ of 50 bits telling all about L’s true iden­tity and how you dis­cov­ered it, you need to kill an Ola­fur Ja­cobs of Tan­za­nia who weighs more than 200 pounds and is from Tai­wan, but alas! Ja­cobs doesn’t exist for you to kill.
    
2.  the **time**
    
    The ‘when’ is han­dled by sim­i­lar rea­son­ing. There is a cer­tain gran­u­lar­ity to Death Note kills: even if _it_ is ca­pa­ble of tim­ing deaths down to the nanosec­ond, one can’t ac­tu­ally wit­ness this or re­ceive records of this. Doc­tors may note time of death down to the minute, but no finer (and how do you get such pre­cise med­ical records any­way?). News re­ports may be even less ac­cu­rate, not­ing merely that it hap­pened in the morn­ing or in the late evening. In rare cases like live broad­casts, one may be able to do a lit­tle bet­ter, but even they tend to be de­layed by a few sec­onds or min­utes to allow for buffer­ing, tech­ni­cal glitches be fixed, the stenog­ra­phers pro­duce the closed cap­tion­ing, or sim­ply to guard against em­bar­rass­ing events (like Janet Jack­son’s nipple- slip). So we’ll not as­sume the tim­ing can be more ac­cu­rate than the minute. But which min­utes does a Death Note user have to choose from? Inas­much as the Death Note is ap­par­ently in­ca­pable of in­flu­enc­ing the past or caus­ing Pratch­et­t­ian⁠ [21](#fn:21) su­per­lu­mi­nal ef­fects, the past is off- limits; but mes­sages also have to be sent in time for what­ever they are sup­posed to in­flu­ence, so one can­not af­ford to have a win­dow of a cen­tury. If the mes­sage needs to af­fect some­thing within the day, then the user has a win­dow of only 60 · 24 = 1,440 min­utes, which is log 2 (1,440) = 10.49 bits; if the user has a win­dow of a year, that’s slightly bet­ter, as a death’s tim­ing down to the minute could em­body as much as log 2 (60 · 24 · 365) = 19 bits. (Over a decade then is 22.3 bits, etc.) If we allow tim­ing down to the sec­ond, then a year would be 24.9 bits. In any case, it’s clear that we’re not going to get more than 33 bits from the date. On the plus side, an ‘IP over Death’ pro­to­col would be su­pe­rior to [some other pro­to­cols ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers) —here, the worse your la­tency, the more bits you could ex­tract from the packet’s time­stamp! _[Di­nosaur Comics ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Comics)_ on [⁠com­pres­sion schemes ⁠](https://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=354):

    “Yeah, but there’s more to being smart than know­ing com­pres­sion schemes!” “No there’s not!” “Shoot—he knows the se­cret!!” –Ryan North
    
3.  the **cir­cum­stances** (such as the place)
    
    The ‘how’… has many more de­grees of free­dom. The cir­cum­stances is much more dif­fi­cult to cal­cu­late. We can sub­di­vide it in a lot of ways; here’s one:
    
    1.  Lo­ca­tion (eg. lat­i­tude/ lon­gi­tude)
        
        Earth has ~510,072,000,000 square me­ters of sur­face area; most of it is en­tirely use­less from our per­spec­tive—if some­one is in an air­plane and dies, how on earth does one fig­ure out the exact square meter he was above? Or on the oceans? Earth has ~148,940,000,000 square me­ters of _land_, which is more us­able: the usual cal­cu­la­tions gives us log 2 (148940000000) = 37.12 bits. (Sur­prised at how sim­i­lar to the ‘who?’ bit cal­cu­la­tion this is? But 37.12 - 33 = 4.12 and 2 4.12 = 17.4. The SF clas­sic _[Stand on Zanz­ibar ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_on_Zanzibar)_ drew its name from the ob­ser­va­tion that the 7 bil­lion peo­ple alive in 2010 15ya would fit in Zanz­ibar only if they stood shoul­der to shoul­der—spread them out, and mul­ti­ply that area by ~18…) This raises an issue that af­fects all 3: how much can the Death Note con­trol? Can it move vic­tims to ar­bi­trary points in, say, Siberia? Or is it lim­ited to within dri­ving dis­tance? etc. Any of those is­sues could shrink the 37 bits by a great deal.
        
    2.  Cause Of Death
        
        The [⁠In­ter­na­tional Clas­si­fi­ca­tion of Dis­eases](https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases) lists up­wards of 20,000 dis­eases, and we can imag­ine thou­sands of pos­si­ble ac­ci­den­tal or de­lib­er­ate deaths. But what mat­ters is what gets com­mu­ni­cated: if there are 500 dis­tinct brain can­cers but the death is only re­ported as ‘brain can­cer’, the 500 count as 1 for our pur­poses. But we’ll be gen­er­ous and go with 20,000 for re­ported dis­eases plus ac­ci­dents, which is log 2 (20000) = 14.3 bits.
        
    3.  Ac­tion Prior To Death
        
        Ac­tions prior to death over­laps with ac­ci­den­tal causes; here the se­ries doesn’t help us. Light’s early ex­per­i­ments cul­mi­nat­ing in the “L, do you know death gods love ap­ples?” seem to imply that ac­tions are lim­ited in [en­tropy ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_\(information_theory\)) as each word took a death (as­sum­ing the or­di­nary Eng­lish vo­cab­u­lary of 50,000 words, 16 bits), but other plot events imply that hu­mans can un­der­take long com­plex plans at the order of Death Notes (like Mikami bring­ing the fake Death Note to the final con­fronta­tion with Near). Ac­tions be­fore death could be re­ported in great de­tail, or they could be hid­den under of­fi­cial se­crecy like the afore­men­tioned death gods men­tioned (Light uniquely priv­i­leged in learn­ing it suc­ceeded as part of L test­ing him). I can’t begin to guess how many dis­tinct nar­ra­tives would sur­vive trans­mis­sion or what lim­its the Note would set. We must leave this one un­de­fined: it’s al­most surely more than 10 bits, but how many?
        

Sum­ming, we get <33 + <19 + 17 + <37 + 14 +? = 120? bits per death.

## “Bayesian Jurisprudence”

[E.T. Jaynes ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes) in his posthu­mous [_⁠Prob­a­bil­ity The­ory: The Logic of Sci­ence_ ⁠](https://omega0.xyz/omega8008/JaynesBookPdf.html) (on [Bayesian sta­tis­tics ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics)) in­cludes a chap­ter 5 on [“Queer Uses For Prob­a­bil­ity The­ory” ⁠](https://omega0.xyz/omega8008/ETJ-PS/cc5d.ps), dis­cussing such top­ics as ESP; mir­a­cles; heuris­tics & [bi­ases ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias); how vi­sual per­cep­tion is theory- laden; phi­los­o­phy of sci­ence with re­gard to New­ton­ian me­chan­ics and the famed [dis­cov­ery of Nep­tune ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_Neptune); horse- racing & weather fore­cast­ing; and fi­nally—sec­tion 5.8, “Bayesian ju­rispru­dence”. Jaynes’s analy­sis is some­what sim­i­lar in spirit to my above analy­sis, al­though mine is not ex­plic­itly Bayesian ex­cept per­haps in the dis­cus­sion of gen­der as elim­i­nat­ing one nec­es­sary bit.

The fol­low­ing is an ex­cerpt; see also [⁠“Bayesian Jus­tice” ⁠](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xx7TeDmBQDFnx8GY7/bayesian-justice).

> It is in­ter­est­ing to apply prob­a­bil­ity the­ory in var­i­ous sit­u­a­tions in which we can’t al­ways re­duce it to num­bers very well, but still it shows au­to­mat­i­cally what kind of in­for­ma­tion would be rel­e­vant to help us do plau­si­ble rea­son­ing. Sup­pose some­one in New York City has com­mit­ted a mur­der, and you don’t know at first who it is, but you know that there are 10 mil­lion peo­ple in New York City. On the basis of no knowl­edge but this, _e_ (Guilty|X) = −70 _db_ is the plau­si­bil­ity that any par­tic­u­lar per­son is the guilty one.
> 
> How much pos­i­tive ev­i­dence for guilt is nec­es­sary be­fore we de­cide that some man should be put away? Per­haps +40 _db_, al­though your re­ac­tion may be that this is not safe enough, and the num­ber ought to be higher. If we raise this num­ber we give in­creased pro­tec­tion to the in­no­cent, but at the cost of mak­ing it more dif­fi­cult to con­vict the guilty; and at some point the in­ter­ests of so­ci­ety as a whole can­not be ig­nored.
> 
> For ex­am­ple, if 1,000 guilty men are set free, we know from only too much ex­pe­ri­ence that 200 or 300 of them will pro­ceed im­me­di­ately to in­flict still more crimes upon so­ci­ety, and their es­cap­ing jus­tice will en­cour­age 100 more to take up crime. So it is clear that the dam­age to so­ci­ety as a whole caused by al­low­ing 1,000 guilty men to go free, is far greater than that caused by falsely con­vict­ing one in­no­cent man.
> 
> If you have an emo­tional re­ac­tion against this state­ment, I ask you to think: if you were a judge, would you rather face one man whom you had con­victed falsely; or 100 vic­tims of crimes that you could have pre­vented? Set­ting the thresh­old at +40 _db_ will mean, crudely, that on the av­er­age not more than one con­vic­tion in 10,000 will be in error; a judge who re­quired ju­ries to fol­low this rule would prob­a­bly not make one false con­vic­tion in a work­ing life­time on the bench.
> 
> In any event, if we took +40 db start­ing out from −70 db, this means that in order to en­sure a con­vic­tion you would have to pro­duce about 110 db of ev­i­dence for the guilt of this par­tic­u­lar per­son. Sup­pose now we learn that this per­son had a mo­tive. What does that do to the plau­si­bil­ity for his guilt? Prob­a­bil­ity the­ory says
> 
> (5-38)
> 
> since , i.e. we con­sider it quite un­likely that the crime had no mo­tive at all. Thus, the [im­por­tance] of learn­ing that the per­son had a mo­tive de­pends al­most en­tirely on the prob­a­bil­ity that an in­no­cent per­son would also have a mo­tive.
> 
> This ev­i­dently agrees with our com­mon sense, if we pon­der it for a mo­ment. If the de­ceased were kind and loved by all, hardly any­one would have a mo­tive to do him in. Learn­ing that, nev­er­the­less, our sus­pect _did_ have a mo­tive, would then be very [im­por­tant] in­for­ma­tion. If the vic­tim had been an un­sa­vory char­ac­ter, who took great de­light in all sorts of foul deeds, then a great many peo­ple would have a mo­tive, and learn­ing that our sus­pect was one of them is not so [im­por­tant]. The point of this is that we don’t know what to make of the in­for­ma­tion that our sus­pect had a mo­tive, un­less we also know some­thing about the char­ac­ter of the de­ceased. But how many mem­bers of ju­ries would re­al­ize that, un­less it was pointed out to them?
> 
> Sup­pose that a very en­light­ened judge, with pow­ers not given to judges under present law, had per­ceived this fact and, when tes­ti­mony about the mo­tive was in­tro­duced, he di­rected his as­sis­tants to de­ter­mine for the jury the _num­ber_ of peo­ple in New York City who had a mo­tive. If this num­ber is then

> and equa­tion (5-38) re­duces, for all prac­ti­cal pur­poses, to
> 
> (5-39)
> 
> You see that the pop­u­la­tion of New York has can­celed out of the equa­tion; as soon as we know the num­ber of peo­ple who had a mo­tive, then it doesn’t mat­ter any more how large the city was. Note that (5-39) con­tin­ues to say the right thing even when is only 1 or 2.
> 
> You can go on this way for a long time, and we think you will find it both en­light­en­ing and en­ter­tain­ing to do so. For ex­am­ple, we now learn that the sus­pect was seen near the scene of the crime shortly be­fore. From [Bayes’ the­o­rem ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem), the [im­por­tance] of this de­pends al­most en­tirely on how many in­no­cent per­sons were also in the vicin­ity. If you have ever been told not to trust Bayes’ the­o­rem, you should fol­low a few ex­am­ples like this a good deal fur­ther, and see how in­fal­li­bly it tells you what in­for­ma­tion would be rel­e­vant, what ir­rel­e­vant, in plau­si­ble rea­son­ing.⁠ [22](#fn:22)

    **So, what’s the so­lu­tion?**
    
    We do not be­lieve that there ex­ists a tech­ni­cal so­lu­tion to the prob­lem of anonymity in so­cial net­works. Specif­i­cally, we do not be­lieve that any graph trans­for­ma­tion can (a) sat­isfy a ro­bust de­f­i­n­i­tion of pri­vacy, (b) with­stand de- anonymization at­tacks de­scribed in our paper, and (c) pre­serve the util­ity of the graph for com­mon data- mining and ad­ver­tis­ing pur­poses. There­fore, we ad­vo­cate non- technical so­lu­tions.
    
    So, the de- anonymizing just hap­pens [⁠be­hind closed doors ⁠](https://web.archive.org/web/20130114231753/http://33bits.org/2012/12/17/new-developments-in-deanonymization/):
    
    …re­searchers don’t have the in­cen­tive for deanonymiza­tion any­more. On the other hand, if ma­li­cious en­ti­ties do it, nat­u­rally they won’t talk about it in pub­lic, so there will be no PR fall­out. Reg­u­la­tors have not been very ag­gres­sive in in­ves­ti­gat­ing anonymized data re­leases in the ab­sence of a pub­lic out­cry, so that may be a neg­li­gi­ble risk. Some have ques­tioned whether deanonymiza­tion in the wild is ac­tu­ally hap­pen­ing. I think it’s a bit silly to as­sume that it isn’t, given the eco­nomic in­cen­tives. Of course, I can’t prove this and prob­a­bly never can. No com­pany doing it will pub­licly talk about it, and the pri­vacy harms are so in­di­rect that tying them to a spe­cific data re­lease is next to im­pos­si­ble. I can only offer anec­dotes to ex­plain my po­si­tion: I have been ap­proached mul­ti­ple times by or­ga­ni­za­tions who wanted me to deanonymize a data­base they’d ac­quired, and I’ve had friends in dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries men­tion ca­su­ally that what they do on a daily basis to com­bine dif­fer­ent data­bases to­gether is es­sen­tially deanonymiza­tion.
    
    In gen­eral, there’s no clear dis­tinc­tion be­tween ‘use­ful’ and ‘use­less’ in­for­ma­tion from the per­spec­tive of iden­ti­fy­ing/ break­ing pri­vacy/ re­vers­ing anonymiza­tion ([⁠em­pha­sis added ⁠](https://web.archive.org/web/20110314105222/http://33bits.org/2009/10/14/de-anonymization-is-not-x-the-need-for-re-identification-science/)):
    
    ‘Quasi- identifier’ is a no­tion that arises from at­tempt­ing to see some at­trib­utes (such as ZIP code) but not oth­ers (such as tastes and be­hav­ior) as con­tribut­ing to re- identifiability. How­ever, the major les­son from the re- identification pa­pers of the last few years has been that _any in­for­ma­tion at all about a per­son_ can be po­ten­tially used to aid re- identification.[↩](#fnref:17)

    The only things known to go faster than or­di­nary light is monar­chy, ac­cord­ing to the philoso­pher Ly Tin Wee­dle. He rea­soned like this: you can’t have more than one king, and tra­di­tion de­mands that there is no gap be­tween kings, so when a king dies the suc­ces­sion must there­fore pass to the heir _in­stan­ta­neously_. Pre­sum­ably, he said, there must be some el­e­men­tary par­ti­cles—kingons, or pos­si­bly queons—that do this job, but of course suc­ces­sion some­times fails if, in mid- flight, they strike an anti- particle, or re­pub­li­con. His am­bi­tious plans to use his dis­cov­ery to send mes­sages, in­volv­ing the care­ful tor­tur­ing of a small king in order to mod­u­late the sig­nal, were never fully ex­panded be­cause, at that point, the bar closed.[↩](#fnref:21)
    
22.  “Note that in these cases we are try­ing to de­cide, from scraps of in­com­plete in­for­ma­tion, on the truth of an Aris­totelian propo­si­tion; whether the de­fen­dant did or did not com­mit some well- defined ac­tion. This is the sit­u­a­tion an issue of fact for which prob­a­bil­ity the­ory as logic is de­signed. But there are other legal sit­u­a­tions quite dif­fer­ent; for ex­am­ple, in a med­ical mal­prac­tice suit it may be that all par­ties are agreed on the facts as to what the de­fen­dant ac­tu­ally did; the issue is whether he did or did not ex­er­cise rea­son­able judg­ment. Since there is no of­fi­cial, pre­cise de­f­i­n­i­tion of ‘rea­son­able judg­ment’, the issue is not the truth of an Aris­totelian propo­si­tion (how­ever, if it were es­tab­lished that he will­fully vi­o­lated one of our Chap­ter 1 desider­ata of ra­tio­nal­ity, we think that most ju­ries would con­vict him). It has been claimed that prob­a­bil­ity the­ory is ba­si­cally in­ap­plic­a­ble to such sit­u­a­tions, and we are con­cerned with the par­tial truth of a non- Aristotelian propo­si­tion. We sug­gest, how­ever, that in such cases we are not con­cerned with an issue of truth at all; rather, what is wanted is a value judg­ment. We shall re­turn to this topic later (Chap­ters 13, 18).” [](https://gwern.net/death-note-anonymity#fnref22)[↩](#fnref:22)
