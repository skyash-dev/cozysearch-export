  "dek": "This article explores \"motive ambiguity,\" where seemingly worse actions are chosen to signal a specific intention, highlighting the disconnect between optimal outcomes and demonstrable commitment.  Examples range from choosing a less desirable restaurant to show love, to a manager prioritizing short-term gains over long-term consequences to prove loyalty. The core idea is that sometimes, the best action is not the one that yields the best result, but the one that most clearly conveys the actor's true motive.",
