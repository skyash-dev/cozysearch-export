  "dek": "Dove's \"real beauty\" campaign isn't selling beauty products; it's a clever marketing ploy that positions Dove as the authority on beauty, building trust and making consumers more susceptible to purchasing their products later.  The ad uses artistic sketches and a focus on inner beauty to bypass cynicism and create a sense of self-acceptance, ultimately manipulating viewers into associating Dove with genuine, ethical beauty.",
