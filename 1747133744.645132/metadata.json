It examines the characteristics associated with this \"Chinese businessman wisdom,\" questioning its definition and how it can be acquired, contrasting it with other terms like \"business savvy.\" The article uses the example of the author's friend's father, a successful businessman in Kuching, to illustrate the points.",
