Consciousness is not these little word-things you have flying around in your head. Consciousness is concentrated direct interaction between the Will and the World. I’m a musician so the clearest metaphor to me, the nearest metaphor to me, is playing music. The act of concentration, of directing my will very precisely, with the fullness of my being, towards an object, to manipulate the object in a certain, precise, fashion – that is, to press the keys on the piano in the right order at the right time, to produce the desired sounds – this is consciousness. In this moment of perfect concentration, there is zero language. Only Will and Action. This is where “I” “am”, the most. Compare this sensation to thinking the words: “I am a pianist” - or saying them, or writing them – the comparison is preposterous. The latter does not produce this sense of Being – _it calls it into question_.

Language is inherently “problematising”. To express something in language, is, mechanically or structurally, to create a problem. Maybe you already have a problem with something in the world, then you articulate it in language to figure it out, very good – but ah. What then? What happens when you finally solve whatever it was? When you “find” the “solution”?

“Aaah!” You _stop thinking_ about it!

All naming of things, all articulation in language, is to cast suspicion - “I am a pianist”? My lady doth protest too much. Improvise a the part structure right now or it didn’t happen. Pics or it didn’t happen.

If it was the case that consciousness _was_ language – if it was the case that language was necessary for it in any way, then it would be necessarily true that consciousness _is, in part or in whole, a “problem”_. And it would follow necessarily that you would become an anti-natalist or a pessimist or a True Detective. But here’s the trick: try singing a little song, see what happens. Try lifting weights over your head 3x12 times. See what happens.

Aaah! You stop thinking about it!

The relief that is felt after being named correctly, of someone else saying something that makes you go “yes! yes! exactly!”, and feeling “recognized” and “seen”, is not produced from having found the “true name” for any given thing. It is not a relief from having found “the right words”. It is the relief that you _no longer have to think about it._ It is not the fulfilment of language, is it the destruction of language, making language superfluous. There is no pleasure “in” language, there is only the pleasure (relief) of being freed from language.

Music is not the fundamental metaphor or shape, it is simply a metaphor that is near and dear to me. The same principle applies to all “craft” or “skill” of which musical instruments are only a tiny subset. All _technê_. All practical skill. The principle is something like, “focused, precise, skilful manipulating of objects in space/across time”. But due to the limitations of language and the aforementioned “nature” or “structure” of language, to find a fully satisfactory and descriptive name is impossible_._ Get in, we are bullying the Aristotelians.

Picture theory of language? Language referencing objects? Pics or it didn’t happen.

To “say what you are” is to _doubt_ it. To _claim_ an “identity” is to structurally admit that whatever you are, you _not certain_ that you are whatever thing you claim. It is, in language game terms, a gamble and a bluff, and usually an attempt at intimidation - either of the audience or the speaker himself.

The _picture_ theory of language was created by people who _can’t paint_. The _correspondence_ theory of truth was developed by people who _didn’t have any friends_.

If you have a bad body, and your body hurts and aches _so much that you can’t seem to focus on solving your life/spirit/soul/psychological_ problems? If you tell yourself, ah, not right now, I can’t focus on that stuff right now because _I don’t feel so good (physically),_ I cant _collect my thoughts_? Right now?

That IS your psychological problem right there. THAT is your psychological problem. Not those little word things flying around in your head. Your psychological problem is that you do not have well developed back muscles. Your soul problem is that you have a bad cardiovascular system. Your spirit problem is that your _heart_ is literally _weak_. Life problems, may or may not be related. Maybe some shit is going on with you, I don’t know. Maybe you got some antagonists or some social problems, it’s very likely, happens to people all the time. I wouldn’t presume either way.

The best picture of the human soul is the human body.
