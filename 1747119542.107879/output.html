Exhibit B: Detroit.) If you consider the typical consumer’s theoretical balance sheet, the single biggest item on that balance sheet is the net present value of their future wages: unless you’re quite late in your career or made some very savvy trades, this dwarfs your savings and investments. From the consumer’s perspective, this asset is very hard to hedge: if your savings are in stocks, you can sell stocks or buy put options; if your net worth is the net present value of the next 30 years of your earnings as a radiologist or car mechanic, there isn’t a trade you can make that pays off directly in proportion to how much those wages drop.

If a company borrows money for 30 years, they can often pay it back at any time, but if rates have dropped (and thus the present value of that bond has risen), they’ll have to pay it back at a premium. For example, suppose a company borrows at 4% for 30 years, and the next day the prevailing rate is 3%. To buy back that bond, they’d need to pay about 120 cents on the dollar. Not so for a mortgage borrower: the borrower has the option to refinance their mortgage if rates move to their advantage, but can keep the mortgage if rates rise. Essentially they have an embedded option. Depending on the volatility of interest rates, this can be quite valuable. Certainly, the paucity of companies making this bet implies that it’s not the approach everybody chooses when they’ve done the math.</li></ol><p id="3ff4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">So the default life path for the ~2/3 of Americans who own their homes is to borrow a bunch of money to double-down on a bet they didn’t even want to make in the first place, <em class="nk">and</em> it’s coupled with an interest rate option.</p><p id="6f39" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now, one might argue that this is the obvious right way to do things, but one would not be thinking very hard.

Prior to that, ~55% of Americans rented. Of the Americans who owned homes, most used five-year mortgages, which they’d refinance if necessary at the end of the term. Since five years is a lot closer to the average time someone will occupy a home, especially in a dynamic and growing economy like the one we used to take for granted, this was a good way to structure the market. What Fannie offered was a guarantee to mortgage lenders: if a bank lent money to a homeowner, and that homeowner defaulted, Fannie, not the bank, would make up the loss. Fannie charged a sort of insurance premium for this, but it was a nominal premium — the exact approach was that Fannie bought mortgages from lenders, packaged similar mortgages together, and sold the cash flows of those mortgages. Fannie had a de facto government guarantee for their debt, so their own cost of capital was low; this implicit subsidy allowed them to price insurance cheaply, which in turn meant that the could encourage more lending.</p><p id="f3e0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This was one of many New Deal-era experiments in stimulating the economy.

Gender inequality actually encourages earlier marriage and childbearing since there’s less of a career for mom to give up on. This is self-perpetuating in two ways: first, earlier childbearing means that women are more likely to leave the workforce, which puts pressure on their wages. Second, few double-earner households means less competitive bidding for real estate. Now the norm is either two earners forever or two earners until the couple can afford a down payment and save some more besides; since they’re house-shopping as two full-time earners, this puts housing out of reach of most single-earner households.</li><li id="ed68" class="mm mn gv mo b mp pf mr ms mt pg mv mw mx ph mz na nb pi nd ne nf pj nh ni nj pc pd pe bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">We had a few more years of productivity growth ahead of us.

As the risk premium declines, the price rises, so sufficiently risk-tolerant individuals can achieve high rates of return.[5] Because of this bias, and because of the general chaos of the Depression, we accepted the idea that subsidizing mortgages was a good approach.</p><p id="7811" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">But mathematically, real estate can be a good investment only based on some combination of the following:</p><ol class=""><li id="dd3c" class="mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj pc pd pe bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">A general increase in rents, which just means an increase in local wages relative to the supply of local housing stock</li><li id="bd75" class="mm mn gv mo b mp pf mr ms mt pg mv mw mx ph mz na nb pi nd ne nf pj nh ni nj pc pd pe bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">An increase in the price to rent ratio</li></ol><p id="c5aa" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">For homeowners, growth in either of these is good.

It was a good way to build wealth when housing was cheap; it’s a good way to destroy it when housing is expensive. Americans are socialized to think that buying a house and getting a mortgage means being a “homeowner,” but the more debt you have and the less means you have to service your debt, the more it’s just way to be a highly leveraged real estate speculator.</p><p id="01c2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">When the logic of an investment changes from the ex ante expectation of direct returns (how much housing you get for the cash you spend) to the ex post extrapolation of realized returns (how much money you would have made if you’d put 10% down to buy in this neighborhood ten years ago), prices are no longer anchored to economic fundamentals, so you get a bubble.

If you buy bonds, you care about their yield, but you also spend a lot of time thinking about their duration. Duration has two equivalent meanings: it’s a measure of the weighted average time at which an investor receives cash flows, and it’s a measure of the asset’s sensitivity to interest rate changes. Intuitively, an asset that matures next week is pretty insensitive to interest rate changes, whereas for a hundred-year zero-coupon bond, a small change in market interest rates produces a huge change in the value of the bond.</p><p id="46cd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Many fixed-income investors have quantifiable liabilities that also have an expected duration. A pension fund manager, for example, knows the approximate average date on which the fund pays out — if interest rates fall, the present value of the pension’s liabilities rise. So it’s not uncommon for fixed-income investors to run a duration-hedged strategy: if the duration of their liabilities is, say, seven years, then they’ll make sure the duration of their assets is seven years, too, so any change in interest rates affects their assets and liabilities equally.</p><p id="c474" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The mortgage prepayment option does something very interesting to duration: it means that when rates decline, more mortgages get repaid, so duration declines. If you’re an investor, this is the last thing you want. Suppose you’re the investor above, with the seven-year duration liabilities, and you own agency securities (i.e. the mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddie). Rates fall, raising the value of your liabilities, and raising the value of your fixed-income assets — except the mortgages. Those get paid down at 100 cents on the dollar; now your assets are <em class="nk">less</em> sensitive to rate changes, just when you were benefiting.</p><p id="aa19" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The opposite is true as well. People naturally repay their mortgages from time to time, and estimated durations take this into account. But if rates rise, people have an incentive to defer moving: if you’re paying 3.5% and moving means paying 5%, you’re strongly incentivized to stay put. So as rates rise (i.e. the value of fixed income assets declines), duration increases — once again, you’re getting the worse end of the bargain.</p><p id="bff6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This has two effects, the obvious and non-obvious.</p><p id="4cbe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The obvious effect is that investors in mortgage-backed securities demand, and get, higher interest rates than they’d get on equivalently creditworthy treasuries.

Freddie was founded in 1970, as a competitor, but it has approximately the same charter as Fannie, and offers the same services. Also it was and is implicitly backed by the same national government.

Now, the US Treasury pockets the difference. So, economically, what happens is that the US government issues debt, buys mortgages, and turns a profit on the gap. As far as anyone knows, the reason the deal’s legal structure doesn’t match that accounting structure is that Fannie and Freddie have a lot of debt, and the government doesn’t want to consolidate it on their balance sheet.

It goes like this: yes, Freddie and Fannie wrote down a bunch of debt, and quickly reached insolvency. <em class="nk">But</em> they later wrote that debt back up! And their loans actually outperformed the competition. In other words, they underwrote responsibly. There are two problems with this: 1) If a company makes levered bets on financial assets, there is no meaningful sense in which they can be “temporarily” insolvent. A financial company doesn’t have a safe balance sheet unless its leverage is acceptable under extreme circumstances. 2) The fact that the GSE didn’t go under when they took enormous writedowns is itself a form of subsidy. Essentially the GSEs got a free CDS contract on their own debt.</p><p id="d78a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Call it the Value At Risk of Dorian Gray: the worse the mortgage market got in 2008, the more of a role Fannie and Freddie played in creating mortgages — which put a bid under housing and thus reduced defaults in their own portfolio. Proponents of the GSEs note that while the GSEs wrote their assets down to the point of insolvency during the crisis, realized losses were lower; they wrote stuff back up eventually. But that’s an appallingly irresponsible argument. <em class="nk">Anyone</em> can make money on levered bets if the loans never get called in. Here’s a surefire strategy: lever up 20 to 1 in equity index futures. When you get a margin call, let it go to voicemail. Historically, stocks have always gone up eventually, and with 2,000% leverage you can make a lot fast. What Fannie and Freddie were doing was artificially encouraging bids for the collateral they’d lent against. And that does prevent defaults, assuming you have unlimited financial firepower. But if you had unlimited financial firepower, why on earth would you use it to keep making bad loans? The more precise Fannie/Freddie version of that levered strategy is: if you lose money, write at-the-money puts on the index at such a huge scale that, for investors, going long is essentially free. Given unlimited capital, it would work.</p><p id="a614" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The whole point of risk management in levered institutions is that you have to ensure that, in a worst-case scenario, you can still roll your short-term debt, i.e. you never reach the point where you literally can’t pay the bills. If you do reach that point, it doesn’t do anybody any good to point out that you’ll eventually be solvent again. “I’ll be solvent in a few years if I don’t have to pay my debts now” is just another way of saying that if your business becomes insolvent and liquidates, the buyers get a good deal.

For prior years, Fannie also doesn’t quantify it, but in earlier years their discloure around changes in credit losses still leads with asset price changes. (“We recognized a benefit for credit losses in 2014 primarily due to increases in home prices of 4.7% in 2014.” “The following factors contributed to our benefit for credit losses in 2013: Home prices increased by 8.8% in 2013 compared with an increase of 4.2% in 2012.”) So the GSEs are <em class="nk">still</em> fundamentally making a bet that housing will go up.</p><p id="e577" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The CBO <a class="af pk" href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2018-08%2F54218-GSEupdate.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">estimates</a> the size of the GSEs’ subsidy at around $1.6bn per year, but this appears to be a gross underestimate, both from a sanity-checking perspective (they previously said mortgage rates would be <a class="af pk" href="https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/2018/54716" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">60 bps higher</a>, or $65bn per year assuming $10.8 trillion mortgages, which is a good lower bound for the actual size of the subsidy) and because of the distortive effects of the GSEs themselves.</p><p id="2140" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s a lower bound, though, because the cost of making good on the guarantee is dependent on the volatility of residential real estate, but the guarantee itself reduces the amplitude of changes in housing prices.

Even for a government anti-poverty program, this is pathologically bad. A house is an illiquid asset whose value is mostly tied to local labor markets. You want people with low incomes to <em class="nk">borrow money to double down</em> on this!? Here’s what will happen: when the one big factory in a one-factory town closes, everybody who rents will leave.

This makes mortgages a countercyclical stabilizer: during good times, rates are high, so people don’t refinance as much; when rates rise, mortgage holders get more cash flow. However, the spending multiplier on this cash is not especially high: for heavily indebted homeowners who have lost their jobs, a cheaper mortgage just means slightly less cash leaving the door every month; their spending is presumably about as low as it can be already. For the very rich, a mortgage is a small proportion of their assets; they have more money in equities, which usually do worse than real estate during a recession. The group that ends up better-off is the middle class. But on the margin, they tend to spend money on things like education, healthcare, and more housing — all fairly low-productivity sectors that have had high inflation in recent decades, with little improvement in quality. From a macroprudential perspective, a better policy would be to distribute cash directly to poor people who <em class="nk">don’t</em> have large mortgage debts, since they’d spend it right away and help boost consumption.</p><p id="557b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Instead, we’re stuck with a weird and crippled financial system that makes it relatively hard to inject lots of liquidity without setting off a bubble in property, as we learned to our chagrin while trying to recover from the post-90s hangover.</p><h1 id="6706" class="nz oa gv be ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">What to Do About It</h1><p id="ec24" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp ox mr ms mt oy mv mw mx oz mz na nb pa nd ne nf pb nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">For the individual, the fact that encouraging 30-year mortgages is a bad policy does not imply that getting one yourself is a bad deal.

So while I think there are prudent asset allocation reasons to favor renting over buying, if you don’t buy into those a standard mortgage is a relatively tax-efficient way to pay for housing.</p><p id="e371" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">From a policy standpoint, the picture is murky as well. Since 2008 didn’t kill the 30-year, you could argue that it will never die. But I’m not so pessimistic: the next few years give us the first opportunity in decades to ween ourselves off our 30-year mortgage addiction. Right now we’re running a fairly expansionary fiscal policy and a relatively contractionary monetary policy. This combination means that mortgage holders don’t have strong reasons to refinance, but they’re not financially stressed. So of all the times that we could start ramping down subsidies to residential housing, this is one of the safest.</p><p id="2d87" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The upshot of this perspective is non-obvious. Bubbles grow by increments but deflate catastrophically, and it’s hard to deflate one by policy. In theory we could try to sunset the GSEs: give them thirty years to slowly wind down their books while offloading the underwriting and guaranteeing business to somebody else. But in practice the consequence of any reform is some combination of a) a large drop in housing prices, which has a catastrophic wealth effect on the middle class, or b) a subsidy that replicates the status quo. Anything that eliminated the GSEs <em class="nk">and</em> didn’t cause any home price drop would have to be functionally equivalent to them.[7]</p><p id="0228" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">And suppose we did pass a law that slowly sunsetted the GSEs.

A real solution to the distortive effects of our current mortgage system would be pretty radical. On the other hand, it’s already quite radical for the US to have pseudo-nationalized two multi-trillion dollar financial institutions, and to use them to subsidize speculation. So really it’s a choice between the radicalism we know (and dislike) and the sort we don’t. A rough outline of how we could go about unwinding the GSEs: distribute the treasury’s stock (perhaps the treasury could “mutualize” the GSEs and distribute shares to agency debt owners), immediately declare that future GSE debt will not be backed by the US government — create rules for treasury disbursements that explicitly block this, and prepare to print dollars. Eliminating the GSE guarantee means eliminating cheap long-term mortgages, which would reduce housing prices. While that’s what we want on average (i.e. to say that housing is artificially expensive is to say that it should be cheaper), the direct economic effect would be painful. To counteract it, the treasury could print additional dollars and buy safe assets or just distribute cash to taxpayers, targeting steady growth in nominal GDP. This would result in near-term disruption to consumers, deflation in real estate prices, and inflation in everything else.</p><p id="b59c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">In other words, it would look exactly like the playbook that every other country with a real estate bubble uses: once the bubble pops, devalue the currency to maintain real growth. The only difference is that in this case, the bubble-popping is done manually, so the stimulus spending can be lined up in advance. Plenty of other countries had bubbles that ultimately ended up driven by real estate: Spain and Ireland in the 2000s; Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the 90s, Japan in the 80s. In every case, devaluation has ultimately been the best choice.</p><p id="b915" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the meantime, for investors and economists there is a clear takeaway.

The usual examples is Florida oranges: if a good orange is a dollar and a bad one is fifty cents, the exchange rate is 2:1; if it costs a dollar to transport a Florida orange to Toronto, the exchange rate is $1.50:$2.00 or 4:3, so Torontonians eat better Florida oranges than Floridians do. This explains why the restaurants in New York and San Francisco are so nice, or at least so fancy.</p><p id="35dd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">[2] Full disclosure: I did this; before I got my driver’s license, I bought some units of an oil and gas royalty trust. Then I moved to New York to avoid ever having to drive. In an act of savvy dynamic hedging, I sold my royalty trust units in order to make my rent.</p><p id="68b3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">[3] One of the things we got right <a class="af pk" href="https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/big-debt-crises-bigger-debt-crises-61abf7990338" rel="noopener">during the recovery from 2008</a> was that liquidity injections should happen at the highest levels of the system, with central banks printing dollars to buy assets; while this is prone to regulatory capture, regulatory capture is less sticky than electoral capture: once half the population receives or expects to receive some benefit, it’s never going away. Whereas it’s quite politically tenable to tell giant banking conglomerates that their free-money aquifer is all tapped out.</p><p id="4b60" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">[4] My theory here is that in espionage, the Russians had an advantage in human intelligence. If you were a Russian citizen sympathetic to capitalism, you might express this by selling black-market cigarettes; if you were an American who had read Marx and thought the Soviets were on to something, you might drop by their embassy and let them in on some important state secrets. And since Marx was popular reading at the same schools that sent lots of people to the foreign policy establishment, there was a pretty decent pipeline of spies and sympathizers. For the US to win, we had to press our competitive advantage: satellites, microphones, cameras, that sort of thing.</p><p id="f258" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">[5] In a way, this is the same directional force that prevailed in other places — Americans vs natives being similar to Normans vs Northumbrians, East Anglians, etc. The difference in how concentrated land ownership was in Norman England versus 19th century Oklahoma may just come down to the relative cost in labor-hours to arm a medieval knight versus a 19th-century rifleman. Who knew the Gini Coefficient in residential real estate ownership was partially a function of the point at which spending money on weapons reaches diminishing marginal returns?</p><p id="85fa" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">[6] Another fun optionality point here: you can think of a mortgage as buying a call option on a house (your down payment is the premium, you gradually exercise the option by paying your mortgage). When vol is higher, you’d expect interest rates to be much higher, but Fannie/Freddie didn’t respond that way. So much of the home buying in the aftermath of the bubble can be best understood as investors taking advantage of the wide disparity between the implied vol of the mortgage cost versus the realized vol they were seeing in the market.</p><p id="1e9a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn gv mo b mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj go bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">[7] I like arguments about which liabilities the US government should or shouldn’t put on their balance sheet. There’s a strong case that since treasuries are denominated in dollars, and we have printing presses, they’re not debt at all; they’re just some kind of warrant where you trade equity now for more equity in the future. But Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the implicit housing subsidy of the GSEs are real, not nominal, liabilities. You can print dollars, but you can’t print healthcare. So arguably all of them <em class="nk">should</em> be on the Fed’s balance sheet.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></article></div><div class="ab ca"><div class="ch bg ga gb gc

However, the spending multiplier on this cash is not especially high: for heavily indebted homeowners who have lost their jobs, a cheaper mortgage just means slightly less cash leaving the door every month; their spending is presumably about as low as it can be already. For the very rich, a mortgage is a small proportion of their assets; they have more money in equities, which usually do worse than real estate during a recession. The group that ends up better-off is the middle class. But on the margin, they tend to spend money on things like education, healthcare, and more housing — all fairly low-productivity sectors that have had high inflation in recent decades, with little improvement in quality.

Eliminating the GSE guarantee means eliminating cheap long-term mortgages, which would reduce housing prices. While that’s what we want on average (i.e. to say that housing is artificially expensive is to say that it should be cheaper), the direct economic effect would be painful.

For the US to win, we had to press our competitive advantage: satellites, microphones, cameras, that sort of thing.","hasDropCap":null,"dropCapImage":null,"markups":[],"codeBlockMetadata":null,"iframe":null,"mixtapeMetadata":null},"Paragraph:aad976d52718_113":{"__typename":"Paragraph","id":"aad976d52718_113","name":"f258","type":"P","href":null,"layout":null,"metadata":null,"text":"[5] In a way, this is the same directional force that prevailed in other places — Americans vs natives being similar to Normans vs Northumbrians, East Anglians, etc. The difference in how concentrated land ownership was in Norman England versus 19th century Oklahoma may just come down to the relative cost in labor-hours to arm a medieval knight versus a 19th-century rifleman.
