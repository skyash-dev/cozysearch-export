<p>This started with a tweet.  I’m embarrassed how often that happens.</p>

<p>Frustrated by a sense of <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai">global mispriorities</a>, I blurted out some snarky and mildly regrettable <a href="https://twitter.com/worrydream/status/631361688931991552">tweets</a> on the lack of attention to climate change in the tech industry (Twitter being a sublime medium for the snarky and regrettable).  Climate change is the problem of our time, it’s everyone’s problem, and most of our problem-solvers are assuming that someone else will solve it.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to one problem-solver, who wrote to ask for specifics&nbsp;—</p>

<p>The notes below are my attempt to answer that question.</p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<p>This is a “personal view”, biased by my experiences and idiosyncrasies.  I’ve followed the climate situation for some time, including working on Al Gore’s book <a href="http://pushpoppress.com/ourchoice/">Our Choice</a>, but I can’t hope to convey the full picture — just a sliver that’s visible from where I’m standing.  I urge you to talk to many scientists and engineers involved in climate analysis and energy, and see for yourself what the needs are and how you can contribute.</p>

<p>This is aimed at people in the tech industry, and is more about what you can do with your career than at a hackathon.  I’m not going to discuss policy and regulation, although they’re no less important than technological innovation.  A good way to think about it, via Saul Griffith, is that <i>it’s the role of technologists to create options for policy-makers.</i></p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<!-- begin chapter --><div class="chapter">
<!-- first left-column --><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<p>I won’t say much about this, but I can’t leave it out. Available funding sources, and the interests and attitudes of the funders, have always had an enormous effect on what technology comes to exist in the world.  In a time of crisis, it’s the responsibility of those holding the capital to sponsor work on averting the crisis.  That is not happening.</p>

<div class="public-structure-captions" data-preview-container="public-structure-preview-container">

<div class="public-structure-caption" style="left:0px;width:142px;">The primary source of public funding in the U.S. for “I’ve got a crazy new idea for energy” is <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov">ARPA-E</a>.  Last year it granted <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov/sites/default/files/ARPA-E%202016%20Budget.pdf">$280 million</a>.</div>

<div class="public-structure-caption" style="left:172px;width:191px;">Incremental innovation is supported by the <a href="http://energy.gov">DOE</a>’s <a href="http://energy.gov/eere/office-energy-efficiency-renewable-energy">Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy</a>, which has a <a href="http://www5.eere.energy.gov/office_eere/program_budget_formulation.php">$2 billion</a> annual budget for a wide range of initiatives.</div>

<div class="public-structure-caption" style="left:385px;width:126px;">The <a href="http://energy.gov">DOE</a> also funds the <a href="http://energy.gov/national-labs">national labs</a>, which do a lot of energy research.</div>

<div class="public-structure-caption" style="left:596px;width:161px;">The <a href="http://www.nsf.gov">NSF</a>’s <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501026">Energy for Sustainability</a> program gives out <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?WT.si_n=ClickedAbstractsRecentAwards&amp;WT.si_x=1&amp;WT.si_cs=1&amp;WT.z_pims_id=501026&amp;ProgEleCode=7644&amp;BooleanElement=Any&amp;BooleanRef=Any&amp;ActiveAwards=true">$18 million</a> annually for academic research.</div>

<div class="public-structure-caption" style="left:772px;width:173px;">Public funding can also be found at the state level, such as the <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov">California Energy Commission</a>’s <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/contracts/epic.html">EPIC</a> program, which has a <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/2014publications/CEC-500-2014-038/CEC-500-2014-038-CMF.pdf">$130 million</a> annual budget.</div>

</div>

<!-- first left-column --><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<div id="public-structure-preview-container"></div>

<p>Possibly the largest source of public funding is in the form of <a href="http://energy.gov/eere/slsc/downloads/guide-federal-financing-energy-efficiency-and-clean-energy-deployment">financing programs</a>, such as <a href="http://energy.gov/lpo/about-us-home">loan guarantees</a> and <a href="http://energy.gov/savings/renewable-electricity-production-tax-credit-ptc">tax credits</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
[The U.S. energy loan program] literally kick-started the whole utility-scale photovoltaic industry... The program funded the first of five huge solar projects in the West... Before that, developers couldn’t get money from private lenders. But now, with proven business models, they can. <span class="cite"><a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/11/13/363572151/after-solyndra-loss-u-s-energy-loan-program-turning-a-profit">(source)</a></span></blockquote>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<p>It’s great that this funding exists, but let’s be clear — it’s a pittance. If we take Saul Griffith’s quote at face value and accept that addressing climate change will take a concerted global effort comparable to World War II, consider that the U.S. spent about <a href="http://cironline.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/June2010CRScostofuswars.pdf">$4 trillion</a> in today’s dollars to “fight the enemy” at that time.  Our present enemy is more threatening, and our financial commitment to the fight is several orders of magnitude off.</p>

<blockquote><span class="author">(Naomi Klein)</span> There is... no scenario in which we can avoid wartime levels of spending in the public sector — not if we are serious about preventing catastrophic levels of warming, and minimizing the destructive potential of the coming storms. <span class="cite"><a href="http://bit.ly/1ZJtgdb">(source)</a></span>
</blockquote>

<p>In the meantime, the fossil fuel industry is being subsidized at about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318162500/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energysubsidies/">half a trillion dollars a year</a>.</p>

<p>Public funding for clean energy is a problem to be solved.  It’s not a technology problem.  But it’s a blocker that prevents us from getting to the technology problems.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/01/ff_solyndra/">read the story</a> of the so-called “cleantech bubble”.  In brief — between 2008 and 2011, about $15 billion of enthusiastic venture capital went into energy-related startups.  There were a few major failures, investors got spooked, and cleantech became taboo.</p>

<p>Late-stage venture funding has dwindled, and early-stage funding has all but disappeared.  Founders spend their days scrounging instead of building.  Consider the American energy storage company <a href="http://www.primuspower.com/">Primus Power</a>, which had to raise its <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/primus-power-secures-20-million-in-first-close-of-series-c-funding-1875328.htm">series C from a South African platinum company</a>, and <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/primus-power-raises-25m-to-bring-flow-batteries-to-kazakhstan">series D from Kazakhstan</a>.</p>

<p>The human race uses <a href="http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2014.pdf">18 terawatts</a>, and will for the foreseeable future.  So there are basically only two scenarios for investors as a collective:</p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<div class="indent">
<p>(a) invest in clean energy immediately; clean energy takes over the <a href="http://selectusa.commerce.gov/industry-snapshots/energy-industry-united-states">$6&nbsp;trillion global energy market</a>; investors get a nice piece of that.</p>

<p>(b) don’t invest in clean energy immediately; fossil fuels <a href="http://www.carbontracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Unburnable-Carbon-Full-rev2-1.pdf">burn past our carbon budget</a>; investors inherit a <a href="http://daniellefong.com/2012/08/27/defusing-the-carbon-bomb/">cinder</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Scenario (a) seems like the most rational plan for everyone, in the long term.  The fact that most investors’ short-term incentives are structured to prefer scenario (b) is a critical problem to be solved.  Again, it’s not a technology problem, but it’s a blocker that prevents us from getting to the technology problems.</p>

<p>In order to stop dumping carbon dioxide into the sky, the world will have to generate its energy “cleanly”.  For the purposes of this essay, that will mean mostly via solar and wind, although geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass, and nuclear will all have parts to play.</p>

<p>This is well-known, but the scale and rate of change required is often unappreciated.  Saul Griffith has a <a href="https://longnow.org/seminars/02009/jan/16/climate-change-recalculated/">good bit about this</a>, suggesting that what’s needed is not throwing up a few solar panels, but a major industrial shift comparable to <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/BigL/BigL-1.html">retooling for World War II</a>.</p>

<p>In 1940 through 1942, U.S. war-related industrial production tripled each year.  That’s over twice as fast as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s law</a>.</p>

<p>The catalyst for such a scale-up will necessarily be political.  But even with political will, it can’t happen without technology that’s <i>capable</i> of scaling, and <i>economically viable</i> at scale.</p>

<p>These projects aren’t about better generators. They are about dramatically reducing the cost of the stuff <i>around</i> the generator.</p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<p>Some of the best news of the last few years is the plunging cost of solar power.  It’s instructive to look at what exactly is <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/29/solar-costs-will-fall-40-next-2-years-heres/">responsible for the drop</a>.  It’s partly cheaper solar panels, due to improved conversion efficiency and falling manufacturing costs.  But panels are now so cheap that they only make up 25% of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_system">total system cost</a>.</p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<p>The majority of the price drop is now due to better inverters, and better mounting racks, and better installation techniques, and better ways for solar companies to interact with customers.

<p>The reason that these reductions in system cost are potentially so significant is the tipping point once solar and wind are consistently cheaper than fossil fuels and can be scaled up to meet demand.</p>

<p>My point here is that there are many ways of contributing toward innovation in the production of clean energy without going off and building a fusion reactor.  Look at the stuff around the things.</p><p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<p>Many home appliances that consume significant electricity — air conditioner, water heater, clothes dryer, electric vehicle charger — have some tolerance in when they actually need to run.  You don’t care exactly when your electric car is charging as long as it’s charged in the morning, and you don’t care exactly when your water heater is heating, as long as the tank stays hot.</p>

<p>If your water heater could talk to your neighbor’s water heater and agree to avoid heating water at the same time, it would flatten out the demand curve, and help avoid the ups and downs that must be serviced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant">peaker plants</a>.  The water heater could also work aggressively when solar power was plentiful and hold back when clouds went by, to match the intermittency of renewables and require less energy storage.</p>

<blockquote>
Demand flexibility uses communication and control technology to shift electricity use across hours of the day while delivering end-use services at the same or better quality but lower cost. It does this by applying automatic control to reshape a customer’s demand profile continuously in ways that either are invisible to or minimally affect the customer. <span class="cite"><a href="http://www.rmi.org/cms/Download.aspx?id=11692&amp;file=RMI-TheEconomicsofDemandFlexibilityExecSummary.pdf">(source)</a></span>

<p><span class="author">(Art Rosenfeld)</span> [In 1975] the CEC’s draft “Title 24” residential building standard proposed to limit window area to 15% of wall area, without distinguishing among north, south, east, and west. Indeed I don’t think the standard even mentioned the sun!</p>
<p>I contacted the CEC and discovered why they thought that windows wasted heat in winter and “coolth” in summer. The CEC staff had a choice of only two public-domain computer programs, the “Post Office” program, which was user hostile... and a newer program [NBSLD]... They chose NBSLD, but unfortunately had run it in a “fixed-thermostat” mode that kept the conditioned space at 72°F (22°C) all year...</p>
<p>NBSLD’s author, Tamami Kusuda, had written a “floating-temperature” option, but it was more complicated and still had bugs, and neither Tamami nor anybody at CEC could get it to work satisfactorily. No wonder the CEC concluded that windows wasted energy!</p>
<p>I decided that California needed two programs for energy analysis in buildings: first and immediately, a simple program for the design of single-family dwellings and, second and later, a comprehensive program for the design of large buildings, with a floating-indoor-temperature option and the ability to simulate HVAC distribution systems... <span class="cite"><a id="foo" href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/commissioners/rosenfeld_docs/2000-10_ROSENFELD_AUTOBIO.PDF">(source)</a></span></p>

<p>You won’t find programming languages mentioned in an <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch">IPCC</a> report.  Their influence is indirect; they get taken for granted.

<p>I was hanging out with climate scientists while working on <a href="http://pushpoppress.com/ourchoice/">Al Gore’s book</a>, and they mostly did their thing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">R</a>.  This is typical; most statistical research is <a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/2011/11/27/kagglers-favorite-tools/">done in R</a>.  The language seems to inspire a level of vitriol that’s impressive even by programmers’ standards.  Even R’s advocates always seem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S9r_YbqHy8">sort of apologetic</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
Using R is a bit akin to smoking. The beginning is difficult, one may get headaches and even gag the first few times. But in the long run, it becomes pleasurable and even addictive. Yet, deep down, for those willing to be honest, there is something not fully healthy in it. <span class="cite"><a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/02/29/comparing-r-to-smoking/">(source)</a></span></blockquote>

<p>Complementary to R is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB">Matlab</a>, the primary language for numerical computing in many scientific and engineering fields.  It’s ubiquitous. Matlab has been described as “the PHP of scientific computing”.</p>

<blockquote>
MATLAB is not good. <a href="https://archive.is/GLnbp">Do not use it.</a> <span class="cite"><a href="https://archive.is/GLnbp">(source)</a></span></blockquote>

<p>R and Matlab are both forty years old, weighed down with forty years of cruft and bad design decisions.  Scientists and engineers use them because they are the vernacular, and there are no better alternatives.</p>

<p>Here’s an opinion you might not hear much — I feel that one effective approach to addressing climate change is contributing to the development of <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>.  Julia is a modern technical language, intended to replace Matlab, R, SciPy, and C++ on the scientific workbench. It’s <a href="http://danluu.com/julialang">immature</a> right now, but it has beautiful <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1607">foundations</a>, enthusiastic users, and a lot of potential.</p>

<p>I say this despite the fact that my own work has been in much the opposite direction as Julia.  Julia inherits the textual interaction of classic Matlab, SciPy, and other children of the teletype — source code and command lines.</p>

<p>The goal of my own research has been tools where scientists see what they’re doing in realtime, with immediate visual feedback and interactive exploration.

<p>Languages like these don’t get mentioned at programming language research <a href="http://splashcon.org">conferences</a>, or in <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org">discussions</a>.  They’re typically dismissed as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific</a>”.  This pejorative reflects a peculiar geocentrism of the programming language community, whose “general-purpose languages” such as Java and Python are in fact very much domain-specific — <i>specific to the domain of software development.</i></p>

<p><a href="http://book.xogeny.com">Modelica</a> is a programming language, but it is not a language for software development!  It’s for developing physical things that affect the physical world — such as the machinery that participates in energy production, energy storage, and energy consumption.  Data flow in Modelica works like no general-purpose language in existence, because it’s designed around how things influence things in physics, not on a CPU.</p>

<p>I started my career <a href="http://worrydream.com/jobsearch/jobsearch.html">designing embedded systems</a>.  Standard practice is:  you design and perhaps simulate your system in Matlab or Simulink or pencil.  You implement it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>.  Sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly</a>, very occasionally someone will sneak some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> or <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> in there.  But the idea that you might implement a control system in an environment designed for designing control systems — it hasn’t been part of the thinking.  This leads to long feedback loops, inflexible designs, and guesswork engineering.  But most critically, it denies engineers the sort of exploratory environment that fosters novel ideas.</p>

<p>The success of <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> has had the perhaps retrograde effect of convincing an entire generation that the way to sense and actuate the physical world is through <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries">imperative method calls in C++</a>, shuffling bits and writing to ports, instead of in an environment designed around signal processing, control theory, and rapid and visible exploration.  As a result, software engineers find a fluid, responsive programming experience on the screen, and a crude and clumsy programming experience in the world.  It’s easier to conjure up virtual fireworks than to blink an LED.  So more and more of our engineers have retreated into the screen.</p>

<h3 id="tools-finding"><a href="#tools-finding">Tools for problem-finding</a></h3>

<p>The tools discussed so far are for scientists and engineers working on a problem.  But let’s back up.  How can someone find the right problem to work on in the first place?  And how can they evaluate whether they have the right ideas to solve it?</p>

<h4>Tools for discovering problems</h4>

<p>Everyone knows the high-level areas that need work:&nbsp;“clean energy”, “carbon capture”, and so on.  But real engineering problems lie in the details —&nbsp;how to <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/siting-wind-farms-quickly-cheaply-0717">quickly estimate</a> wind capacity at a location; how to <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltechs-unique-wind-projects-move-forward-39703">place windmills</a> without aerodynamic interference; how to <a href="http://www.lightsail.com">store energy</a> in compressed air without losing it through heat.</p>

<p>How do we surface these problems?  How can an eager technologist find their way to <i>sub-problems within other people’s projects</i> where they might have a relevant idea?  How can they be exposed to <i>process problems</i> common across many projects?</p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<p>I know a clean-energy inventor who will browse around a <a href="http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/all/all/show/2013/">treemap of global exports</a>, as a crude way to get a feel for the “space of industry”.  She’ll see, for example, “gas turbines”, and get interested in ideas for improved gas turbines.  But then what?  Where does she go from there?</p>

<p>She wishes she could simply click on “gas turbines”, and explore the space:</p>

<div class="indent"><p>
What are open problems in the field?<br>
Who’s working on which projects?<br>
What are the fringe ideas?<br>
What are the process bottlenecks?<br>
What dominates cost? What limits adoption?<br>
<i>Why</i> make improvements here?  How would the world benefit?
</p></div>

<p>None of this information is at her fingertips.  Most isn’t even openly available — companies boast about successes, not roadblocks.  For each topic, she would have to spend weeks tracking down and meeting with industry insiders.  What she’d like is a tool that lets her skim across entire fields, browsing problems and discovering where she could be most useful.</p>

<p>There are many reasons, of course, why organizations tend not to publicize their problems.  But in a planetary crisis, the “secretive competitive company” might not be the ideal organizing structure for human effort.  In an admirable gesture of global goodwill, Tesla recently <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">“open-sourced” their patents</a>, but patents represent <i>solutions</i>.  What if there were some way Tesla could reveal their <i>open problems</i>?</p>

<h4>Tools for evaluating ideas</h4>

<p>Suppose my friend uncovers an interesting problem in gas turbines, and comes up with an idea for an improvement. Now what?</p>

<div class="indent"><p>
Is the improvement <i>significant</i>?<br>
Is the solution technically feasible?<br>
How much would the solution cost to produce?<br>
How much would it <i>need to cost</i> to be viable?<br>
Who would use it?  What are their needs?<br>
What metrics are even relevant?
</p></div>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">
  
<p>Again, none of this information is at her fingertips, or even accessible.  She’d have to spend weeks doing an analysis, tracking down relevant data, getting price quotes, talking to industry insiders.*</p>

<p>What she’d like are tools for quickly estimating the answers to these questions, so she can fluidly explore the space of possibilities and identify ideas that have some hope of being important, feasible, and viable.</p>

<!-- right-column --></div><div class="column-right">

<div class="side-note floaty" style="position:absolute;bottom:0;">
<p>* And that’s assuming she can even find the right people to talk to!

<p>In the case of garbage trucks, the answer is that the technology was developed for a different purpose, and the customer had to figure it out themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
FedEx was the first customer, and we did the medium-duty trucks first. Once we got some publicity with that, I got a call from one of the local garbage service providers... “This looks like it would work great for delivery trucks, [but] can you scale that up to my Class 8 garbage trucks? Will that work?”  We said, we hadn’t thought of that, but let’s go do the engineering and see if it will. In fact, it does, and it works really well. <span class="cite"><a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/05/17/why-is-this-tesla-motors-co-founder-putting-jet-tu.aspx">(source)</a></span></blockquote>

<p>while critics claimed:</p>

<blockquote>Although the program was originally billed as a way to reduce greenhouse gases, it achieves this aim amid huge expense and massive inefficiencies. Cash for Clunkers may diminish our nation’s overall carbon footprint, but the associated costs will be at least 10 times higher than other carbon-reduction strategies. <span class="cite"><a href="http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Environmental-benefits-limited-from-Cash-for-1528663.php">(source)</a></span></blockquote>

<p>Who to believe?</p>

<p>The real question is — why are readers and decision-makers forced to “believe” anything at all?  Many claims made during the debate offered no numbers to back them up.  Claims with numbers rarely provided context to interpret those numbers.  And <i>never</i>&nbsp;were readers shown the <i>calculations</i> behind any numbers. Readers had to make up their minds on the basis of hand-waving, rhetoric, bombast.</p>

<p>Imagine if Blinder’s proposal in the New York Times were written like this:</p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div id="clunker" class="row"><div class="column-left">

<blockquote>
<p>Say we allocate
<span class="adjustable-number" data-var="budget"></span>
for the following program:  Car-owners who trade in an old car that gets less than 
<span class="adjustable-number" data-var="old_MPG_limit"></span>,
and purchase a new car that gets better than 
<span class="adjustable-number" data-var="new_MPG_limit"></span>,
will receive a 
<span class="adjustable-number" data-var="rebate"></span>
rebate.</p>

<p>We estimate that this will get
<span class="calculated-result" data-var="cars_traded"></span> old cars off the road.  It will save
<span class="calculated-result" data-var="gallons_saved"></span> of gas (or
<span class="calculated-result" data-var="hours_of_gas"></span> worth of U.S. gas consumption.)  
It will avoid 
<span class="calculated-result" data-var="tons_CO2e_saved"></span> CO<sub>2</sub>e, or 
<span class="calculated-result" data-var="percent_annual_emissions"></span> of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>

<p>The abatement cost is <span class="calculated-result" data-var="dollars_per_ton_CO2e"></span> per ton CO<sub>2</sub>e of federal spending, although it’s <span class="calculated-result" data-var="dollars_per_ton_CO2e_on_balance"></span> per ton CO<sub>2</sub>e on balance if you account for the money saved by consumers buying less gas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage gives some estimates of what the proposal would actually do.  But there’s something more going on. Some numbers above are <span class="adjustable-number-example">in green</span>.  <b>Drag green numbers <span data-var="drag-help-message"></span> to adjust them.</b>  (Really, do it!)  Notice how the consequences of your adjustments are reflected immediately in the following paragraph. The reader can explore alternative scenarios, understand the tradeoffs involved, and come to an informed conclusion about whether any such proposal could be a good decision.</p>

<p>This is possible because the author is not just publishing <i>words</i>.  The author has provided a <i>model</i> —&nbsp;a set of formulas and algorithms that calculate the consequences of a given scenario.  Some numbers above are <span class="calculated-result-example">in blue</span>.  <b><span data-var="click-help-message"></span> a blue number to reveal how it was calculated.</b>  (<i>“It will save <span class="calculated-result" data-var="gallons_saved" data-no-help="1" style="white-space:normal;"></span>”</i> is a particularly meaty calculation.)  Notice how the model’s <i>assumptions</i> are clearly visible, and can even be adjusted by the reader.</p>

<p>Readers are thus encouraged to examine and critique the model.  If they disagree, they can modify it into a competing model with their own preferred assumptions, and use it to argue for their position.  Model-driven material can be used as grounds for an <i>informed debate</i> about assumptions and tradeoffs.</p>

<p>Modeling leads naturally from the particular to the general.  Instead of seeing an individual proposal as “right or wrong”, “bad or good”, people can see it as one point in a large space of possibilities.  By exploring the model, they come to understand the landscape of that space, and are in a position to invent better ideas for all the proposals to come.  Model-driven material can serve as a kind of <i>enhanced imagination</i>.</p>

They encourage authors to fool themselves, and fool others.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the point of embedding a model is that the reader can explore scenarios within the context of the document.  This requires tools for authoring “dynamic documents” — documents whose contents change as the reader explores the model.  Such tools are pretty much non-existent.</p>

<p>The examples above use <a href="http://worrydream.com/Tangle/">Tangle</a>, a little library I made as a bootstrapping step.  It’s far from the goal of a real dynamic authoring tool.

<h4>Literacy and standards</h4>

<p>The initial proposals I sketched for <a href="http://pushpoppress.com/ourchoice/">Our Choice</a> were interactive graphics with scenario models, where readers could adjust parameters (e.g. pollution rate) and see the estimated effects.  The book editors rejected these, immediately.</p>
<p>The reason was that <i>every number in the text required a citation.</i>  This was especially a concern for Al Gore, whose readership includes an aggressive contingent meticulously seeking proof of his deceptive fabrications.  For the book’s integrity, every number in the book must have appeared previously in a scientific paper.  An interactive graphic which generated its own numbers from an algorithm was unpublishable&nbsp;— <i>even if it used the same algorithm that the scientists themselves used.</i></p>

<p>A commitment to sourcing every fact is laudable, of course.  What’s missing is an understanding of citing and publishing models, not just the data derived from those models.  This is a new problem&nbsp;— older media couldn’t generate data on their own.  Authors will need to figure out journalistic standards around model citation, and readers will need to become literate in how to “read” a model and understand its limitations.</p>

<h4>Geoengineering</h4>

<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering">Geoengineering</a>” refers to “the deliberate large-scale intervention in the earth’s natural systems to counteract climate change”.  The topic was <a href="http://phys.org/news/2009-09-geoengineering-taboo.html">taboo</a> for many years, and it remains “controversial” (a euphemism for “socially risky to advocate”).  As a result, the amount of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/science/panel-urges-more-research-on-geoengineering-as-a-tool-against-climate-change.html?_r=0">research into geoengineering</a> is almost negligible compared to R&amp;D on decarbonization.</p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<p>This is unfortunate, because if total global decarbonization by 2050 doesn’t succeed, we’ll be desperately wishing for some well-developed backup plans.  And even if, by some miracle, it does, we’ll still have <a href="http://www.ipcc-data.org/observ/ddc_co2.html">450-500 ppm of carbon</a> in the atmosphere, not going anywhere, still <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S38/51/51I69/index.xml?section=topstories">wreaking havoc</a>.</p>

<p>Geoengineering is dicey because earth systems are complex and poorly understood, and interventions have unforseen consequences.  To me, this is a clear and urgent call for <i class="urgent">much better tools for understanding complex systems and forseeing consequences.</i></p>

<p>There is almost certainly some set of things we can do at planet-scale that would be effective and safe.  It is almost certainly the case that the best options are <i>ideas that no one has thought of yet.</i>  Who will make the tools to enable people to conceive and verify these ideas?</p>

<p>Fears of geoengineering play into the narrative of a people done in by their hubris.

Human beings now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene">dominate the planet</a>, and it’s folly to pretend that merely “minimizing our impact” will reverse the damage.</p>

<p>In 1968, Stewart Brand began the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/05/stewart-brand-whole-earth-catalog">Whole Earth Catalog</a> with the quip, “We are as gods, and might as well get good at it.”  In 2009, his <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/09/whole-earth-catalog-book-review">Whole Earth Discipline</a> upped the urgency: “We are as gods, and <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/we-are-as-gods-and-have-to-get-good-at-it"><i>have</i> to get good at it</a>.”</p>

<p>If we must be gods, we should at least be cautious and well-informed gods, with the best possible tools for seeing, understanding, and debating our interventions, and the best possible meta-tools for improving those tools.</p>

<p>Foundational technology appears essential only in retrospect.  Looking forward, these things have the character of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown unknowns</a>” — they are rarely sought out (or funded!) as a solution to any specific problem.  They appear out of the blue, initially seem niche, and eventually become relevant to everything.</p>

<p>They may be hard to predict, but they have some common characteristics.  One is that they scale well.  Integrated circuits and the internet both scaled their “basic idea” from a dozen elements to a billion. Another is that they are purpose-agnostic.

<p>I have <a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/">some</a> <a href="http://dsp.rice.edu/cs">candidates</a> <a href="http://jrgreer.caltech.edu/">in mind</a>; here’s one I’d put money on —&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson">Van Jacobson</a>’s <a href="http://named-data.net">new internet protocol</a> is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCZMoY3q2uM">really big deal</a>.  I realize it sounds like overreach to claim that “Named Data Networking” could be fundamental to addressing climate change — that’s my point — but my thought is, how could it <i>not</i>?

<p>Climate change, closely understood, is terrifying.  The natural human response to such a bleak situation is despair.</p>

<p><i>But despair is not useful.</i>  Despair is paralysis, and there’s work to be done.</p>

<p>I feel that this is an essential psychological problem to be solved, and one that I’ve never seen mentioned: How do we create the conditions under which scientists and engineers can do great creative work without <a href="http://www.isthishowyoufeel.com/this-is-how-scientists-feel.html">succumbing</a> <a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36228/ballad-of-the-sad-climatologists-0815/">to</a> <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/07/climate-scientists-face-psychological-problems.html">despair</a>?  And how can new people be encouraged to take up the problem, when their instinct is to turn away and work on something that lets them sleep at night?</p>

<p>Crisis can be motivating for some people in some circumstances — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_Laboratory_(MIT)">Rad Lab</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Manhattan Project</a>, etc. —&nbsp;and there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore">clearly</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amory_Lovins">some</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock">people</a> who draw motivation from the climate crisis.  But as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall_(environmentalist)">George Marshall</a> has  <a href="http://www.climateconviction.org">explored in depth</a>, most people can’t handle it, and need to put it out of their minds.</p>

<p>There are other fields of human endeavor in which morale must be managed quite directly, and they’ve had millenia to develop techniques for “rallying the troops” or “uplifting the congregation”.  I wonder if we can learn from them.  For both the climate worker and the soldier, the likelihood of imminent annihilation is a <i>distraction</i>, and they must be given a frame of mind that lets them concentrate on the work to be done.</p>

<p>Mikey Dickerson, an engineer who left Google to head up the <a href="http://blog.newrelic.com/wp-content/uploads/80893.pdf">heroic rescue of healthcare.gov</a>, concluded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vc8sxhy2I4">a recent talk</a> with a plea to the tech crowd:</p>

<!-- left-column --></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column-left">

<blockquote>
<p>This is real life.  This is your country...  Our country is a place where we allocate our resources through the collective decisions that all of us make...  We allocate our resources to the point where we have thousands of engineers working on things like picture-sharing apps, when we’ve already got dozens of picture-sharing apps.</p>

<p>We do not allocate anybody to problems like [identity theft of kids in foster care, food stamp distribution, the immigration process, federal pensions, the VA]...  This is just a handful of things that I’ve been asked to staff in the last week or so and do not have adequate staff to do...</p>

<p>These are all problems that need the attention of people like you. <span class="cite"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vc8sxhy2I4&amp;t=24m22s">(source)</a></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.asee.org/papers-and-publications/publications/14_11-47.pdf">100,000 people</a> received an engineering bachelor’s degree in the U.S. last year.  There are at least 100,000 people, every year, looking for an engineering problem to solve.  I have my own plea to all such people —

<p>One sometimes gets the feeling, as Ian Bogost put it, of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/future-ennui/380099/">rearranging app icons on the Titanic</a>.  I think the tech community can do better than that. <i>You</i> can do better than that.</p>

<p>Climate change is the problem of our time.  It’s everyone’s problem, but it’s <i>our</i> responsibility — as people with the incomparable leverage of being able to work magic through technology.</p>

<p>In this essay, I’ve tried to sketch out a map of where such magic is needed&nbsp;—&nbsp;systems for producing, moving, and consuming clean energy; tools for building them; media for understanding what needs to be built.  There are opportunities everywhere. Let’s get to work.</p>

<p>“It’s more complicated than that.”  No kidding.  You could nail a list of caveats to any sentence in this essay.  But the complexity of these problems is no excuse for inaction.  It’s an invitation to read more, learn more, come to understand the situation, figure out what you can build, and go build it.  That’s why this essay has 400 hyperlinks.  It’s meant as a jumping-off point.  Jump off it.</p>

<p>There’s one overarching caveat. This essay employed the rhetoric of “problem-solving” throughout.  I was trained as an engineer; engineers solve problems.  But, at least for the next century, the “problem” of climate change will not be “solved” —&nbsp;it can only be “managed”.  This is a long game.  One more reason to be thinking about tools, infrastructure, and foundations.  The next generation has some hard work ahead of them.</p>

<p>So much thanks to Danielle Fong, Paula Te, Patrick Collison, Robert Ochshorn, and Joe Edelman for their help with this essay.  Thanks to Mike Bauerly for asking the question.</p>
