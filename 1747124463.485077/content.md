When I came across this quote, I was struck by its rel­e­vance to one of [Eliezer Yud­kowsky’s ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky) ‘beisut­sukai’ posts about find­ing the suc­ces­sor to quan­tum me­chan­ics, [⁠“The Fail­ures of Eld Sci­ence” ⁠](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZxR8P8hBFQ9kC8wMy/the-failures-of-eld-science).

I meant to write an essay on how in­ter­est­ing it is that we in­tel­lec­tu­ally know that many of our cur­rent the­o­ries must be wrong, and even have pretty good ideas as to which ones, but we still can­not psy­cho­log­i­cally tackle them with the same en­ergy as if we had some anom­aly or para­dox to ex­plain, or have the ben­e­fit of hind­sight. The stu­dents in Eliezer’s story know that quan­tum me­chan­ics is wrong; some­one with a well- verified ob­ser­va­tion con­tra­dict­ing quan­tum me­chan­ics knows that it is wrong (re­place ‘quan­tum’ with ‘clas­si­cal’ as you wish). They will achieve bet­ter re­sults than a bat­tal­ion of con­ven­tional QMists.

But noth­ing quite gelled.

> “—for over 30 years”, Jef­freys­sai said. “Not one of them saw it; not Ein­stein, not Schrödinger, not even von Neu­mann.” He turned away from his sketcher, and to­ward the class­room. “I pose to you to the ques­tion: How did they fail?”

> Bren­nan didn’t jump. He de­lib­er­ately waited just long enough to show he wasn’t scared, and then said, “Lack of prag­matic mo­ti­va­tion, sen­sei.”

> “The Man­hat­tan Project”, Bren­nan said, “was launched with a spe­cific tech­no­log­i­cal end in sight: a weapon of great power, in time of war. But the error that Eld Sci­ence com­mit­ted with re­spect to quan­tum physics had no im­me­di­ate con­se­quences for their tech­nol­ogy. They were con­fused, but they had no des­per­ate need for an an­swer. Oth­er­wise the sur­round­ing sys­tem would have re­moved all bur­dens from their ef­fort to solve it. Surely the Man­hat­tan Project must have done so—Taji? Do you know?”
> 
> Jef­freys­sai chuck­led slightly. “Don’t guess so hard what I might pre­fer to hear, Com­peti­tor. Your first state­ment came closer to my hid­den mark; your oh- so-Bayesian dis­claimer fell wide… The fac­tor I had in mind, Bren­nan, was that Eld sci­en­tists thought it was ac­cept­able to take 30 years to solve a prob­lem. Their en­tire so­cial process of sci­ence was based on get­ting to the truth even­tu­ally. A wrong the­ory got dis­carded even­tu­ally—once the next gen­er­a­tion of stu­dents grew up fa­mil­iar with the re­place­ment. Work ex­pands to fill the time al­lot­ted, as the say­ing goes. But peo­ple can think im­por­tant thoughts in far less than 30 years, if they ex­pect speed of them­selves.” Jef­freys­sai sud­denly slammed down a hand on the arm of Bren­nan’s chair. “How long do you have to dodge a thrown knife?”

— They didn’t _know_ that they were look­ing for a bet­ter the­ory.

The stu­dents in this story have the in­cred­i­ble ad­van­tage that they are start­ing from a wrong the­ory and know this for cer­tain, and not merely sus­pect or hold as a gen­eral philosophy- of-science prin­ci­ple ‘there’s prob­a­bly a bet­ter the­ory than the cur­rent one’. This gives them sev­eral things psy­cho­log­i­cally:

1.  the will­ing­ness to scrap painfully won in­sights and the­o­ries in favor of some­thing new and
    
2.  saves them from spend­ing all their time and ef­fort patch­ing up the old the­ory.
    

I know in the past when I’ve tried my hand at prob­lems (logic puz­zles come to mind) that I am far more mo­ti­vated and ef­fec­tive when I am as­sured that there is in fact a cor­rect an­swer than when I am un­sure the ques­tion is even an­swer­able.

And a quick note to those who think I’m echo­ing Bren­nan: I am, here, but my point dif­fers in that I don’t think it was a mat­ter of ‘train­ing’.

I think if you ab­ducted all the old greats, gave the nec­es­sary ex­per­i­men­tal data, and gave them a few months to pro­duce the new the­ory be­fore they were dragged out to the shed and shot, then they could do it just as well as these stu­dents. It’s all about mo­ti­va­tion.

It’s not a mat­ter of com­pe­tency at par­a­digm shifts, if you will; it’s ac­cept­ing that one needs to hap­pen _now_ and you are the one who needs to do it. But there’s no nor­mal way to con­vince a sci­en­tific com­mu­nity of this; isn’t it true that most new par­a­digms fail to pan out?

From [⁠“Class Project” ⁠](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xAXrEpF5FYjwqKMfZ/class-project):

> Jef­freys­sai took a mo­ment to look over his in­creas­ingly dis­turbed stu­dents, “Here is your as­sign­ment. Of quan­tum me­chan­ics, and Gen­eral Rel­a­tiv­ity, you have been told. This is the limit of Eld sci­ence, and hence, the limit of pub­lic knowl­edge. The 5 of you, work­ing on your own, are to pro­duce the cor­rect the­ory of quan­tum grav­ity. Your time limit is one month.”
> 
> Or­di­nar­ily, at this point, I would say: “Now I am about to tell you the an­swer; so if you want to try to work out the prob­lem on your own, you should do so now.” But in this case, some of the great­est sta­tis­ti­cians in his­tory did not get it on their own, so if you do not al­ready know the an­swer, I am not re­ally ex­pect­ing you to work it out. Maybe if you re­mem­ber half a hint, but not the whole an­swer, you could try it on your own. Or if you sus­pect that your era will sup­port you, you could try it on your own; I have given you a tremen­dous amount of help by ask­ing ex­actly the cor­rect ques­tion, and telling you that an an­swer is pos­si­ble.

> Back to the fall of ’74/ ’75. We were hold­ing the sem­i­nar, I met this man Peter Blat­man and he told me about Ralph Merkle. And this is dis­cussed also in [“The First 10 Years of Public- Key Cryp­tog­ra­phy” ⁠](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.368.79&rep=rep1&type=pdf). He said Merkle had been work­ing on the prob­lem of se­cure com­mu­ni­ca­tion over a chan­nel with some­body you’d never met be­fore and I had thought about that prob­lem for a long time. I was con­vinced you couldn’t do it and I per­suaded Blat­man you couldn’t do it. But I went back think­ing about the prob­lem. And so I think Merkle plays a very crit­i­cal role.
> 
> As it turned out Merkle al­ready prob­a­bly [knew how to do it at that time ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%27s_Puzzles), but he saw the prob­lem dif­fer­ently from the way I did. Merkle took Hoff­man’s class. Hoff­man wanted every­body do a term paper, and he wanted a pro­posal for the term paper very early in the term. So Merkle sub­mit­ted a pro­posal which is a paper about his key ex­change sys­tem and Hoff­man didn’t un­der­stand it and Hoff­man made him rewrite it and he still didn’t un­der­stand it. And they got fed up with each other and Merkle left the class. And Hoff­man threw away the chance to have the well known names read Merkle and Hoff­man rather than Diffie and Hell­man. And Merkle went on work­ing on that prob­lem and even­tu­ally wrote a paper that fi­nally ap­peared as [“Se­cure com­mu­ni­ca­tion over in­se­cure chan­nels” ⁠](https://ralphmerkle.com/1974/PuzzlesAsPublished.pdf) about 5 years later [CACM 1978 47ya]. Part of the rea­son that it wasn’t ap­pre­ci­ated sooner is that Ralph Merkle didn’t write very well. I have a draft some­where, he wrote a hun­dred pages paper or some­thing, it was very very hard to read. … That’s in essence all of what I called the pre- history. Then as we thought about this for sev­eral months and we wrote a paper that even­tu­ally ap­peared in the Na­tional Com­puter Con­fer­ence in 1976 49ya, and that was writ­ten in De­cem­ber 1975 50ya. And we sent preprints around and we dead­lined a sub­mis­sion for the con­fer­ence very early, had to give in be­fore Christ­mas, or by Jan­u­ary, 1 st. or some­thing like that and im­me­di­ately we sent the preprints around very widely and I gave one to Blat­man who gave it to Merkle. And Merkle, who had been beat­ing his head against a stonewall for years, sud­denly re­al­ized, here were peo­ple who would un­der­stand what he was talk­ing about. So Merkle then got in con­tact with us, he called me be­cause I lived in Berke­ley and sent Marty Hell­man a copy of his paper, be­cause Hell­man was far­ther away.

This story from that pe­riod is a clas­sic:
> 
> > Dur­ing my first year at Berke­ley I ar­rived late one day to one of Ney­man’s classes. On the black­board were two prob­lems which I as­sumed had been as­signed for home­work. I copied them down. A few days later I apol­o­gized to Ney­man for tak­ing so long to do the home­work—the prob­lems seemed to be a lit­tle harder to do than usual. I asked him if he still wanted the work. He told me to throw it on his desk. I did so re­luc­tantly be­cause his desk was cov­ered with such a heap of pa­pers that I feared my home­work would be lost there for­ever.
> > 
> > About 6 weeks later, one Sun­day morn­ing about 8 o’clock, Anne and I were awak­ened by some­one bang­ing on our front door. It was Ney­man. He rushed in with pa­pers in hand, all ex­cited: “I’ve just writ­ten an in­tro­duc­tion to one of your pa­pers. Read it so I can send it out right away for pub­li­ca­tion.” For a minute I had no idea what he was talk­ing about. To make a long story short, the prob­lems on the black­board which I had solved think­ing they were home­work were in fact two fa­mous un­solved prob­lems in sta­tis­tics. That was the first inkling I had that there was any­thing spe­cial about them.

> One of [Bill Atkin­son’s ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson) amaz­ing feats (which we are so ac­cus­tomed to nowa­days that we rarely mar­vel at it) was to allow the win­dows on a screen to over­lap so that the “top” one clipped into the ones “below” it. Atkin­son made it pos­si­ble to move these win­dows around, just like shuf­fling pa­pers on a desk, with those below be­com­ing vis­i­ble or hid­den as you moved the top ones. Of course, on a com­puter screen there are no lay­ers of pix­els un­der­neath the pix­els that you see, so there are no win­dows ac­tu­ally lurk­ing un­der­neath the ones that ap­pear to be on top. To cre­ate the il­lu­sion of over­lap­ping win­dows re­quires com­plex cod­ing that in­volves what are called “re­gions.” Atkin­son pushed him­self to make this trick work be­cause he thought he had seen this ca­pa­bil­ity dur­ing his visit to [Xerox PARC ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_\(company\)). In fact the folks at PARC had never ac­com­plished it, and they later told him they were amazed that he had done so. “I got a feel­ing for the em­pow­er­ing as­pect of naïveté”, Atkin­son said. “Be­cause I didn’t know it couldn’t be done, I was en­abled to do it.” He was work­ing so hard that one morn­ing, in a daze, he drove his Corvette into a parked truck and nearly killed him­self. Jobs im­me­di­ately drove to the hos­pi­tal to see him. “We were pretty wor­ried about you”, he said when Atkin­son re­gained con­scious­ness. Atkin­son gave him a pained smile and replied, “Don’t worry, I still re­mem­ber re­gions.”

> Group­ing is pretty easy on the first three maze pat­terns [of the ar­cade game [_Ms. Pac- Man_ ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man)] (waves one through nine). But even the best play­ers al­ways seemed to get wiped out on the fourth maze pat­tern, called the “Ju­nior” boards. The prob­lem was that there didn’t seem to be a hold [safe spot to pause in] on the Ju­nior boards…When they had just about given up, a fel­low by the name of Matt Brass met up with the Think Tank. Brass, a pretty de­cent player him­self, had just re­turned from the North Amer­i­can Video Olympics…he dropped a bomb­shell—some play­ers were group­ing the ghosts on the Ju­nior boards.
> 
> It wasn’t true. Brass wasn’t lying—he had meant to say that some play­ers were group­ing _be­fore_ the Ju­nior boards. But the Think Tank pan­icked….They worked five days straight on the prob­lem…With a lot of re­search [using a mod­i­fied game], the Think Tank, and es­pe­cially Spencer, de­cided that the key to group­ing had to in­volve the four tun­nels…It was Tom who made the [final] break­through. By using Spencer’s method to group three ghosts, he dis­cov­ered a hold!
> 
> The hold, which didn’t seem to exist on the Ju­nior boards, was there—but only if you grouped three of the ghosts be­fore you went into it. With this knowl­edge, it be­came a sim­ple mat­ter of using the tun­nels to group the three ghosts on the run, go into the hold to wait for Sue, and then nail all of them. The Think Tank was soon achiev­ing scores in the 400,000 range, which had been con­sid­ered im­pos­si­ble.

> You can imag­ine how Tom, Don and Spencer felt when they spoke with Matt Brass again and dis­cov­ered the com­mu­ni­ca­tion break­down. The Boze­man Think Tank had done the im­pos­si­ble—only be­cause they mis­tak­enly be­lieved it had al­ready been achieved.

> > It was in the Navy, in a rather strange way, that my fu­ture ca­reer in sta­tis­tics orig­i­nated. I was read­ing in a room, close to two naval of­fi­cers who were dis­cussing the prob­lem of bomb­ing ac­cu­racy. In no way could I keep from over­hear­ing their con­ver­sa­tion: “We’re drop­ping lots of bombs on an airstrip in order to knock it out, but the bomb im­pacts over­lap in a ran­dom man­ner, and it doesn’t do any good to oblit­er­ate the same area 17 times. Once is enough.” They were try­ing to de­cide how many bombs were nec­es­sary to knock out maybe 90% of an area, tak­ing into ac­count the ran­dom­ness of im­pact pat­terns. The two of­fi­cers sus­pected that some re­search groups work­ing on the prob­lem were prob­a­bly drop­ping poker chips on the floor in order to trace them out and mea­sure the total area they cov­ered. Any­way, I fi­nally stopped try­ing to read and asked my­self, what re­ally does hap­pen when you do that? Hav­ing scrib­bled some­thing on a piece of paper, I walked over to the of­fi­cers and of­fered them a sug­ges­tion for at­tack­ing the prob­lem. Since I wasn’t en­gaged in war re­search, they were not em­pow­ered to dis­cuss it with me. So I wrote up a short note and sent it off to one of the two of­fi­cers. In due course, it came to the at­ten­tion of some math­e­mat­i­cal re­search group work­ing on the prob­lem. How­ever, I had no clear­ance to dis­cuss clas­si­fied mat­ters, so there was a real com­mu­ni­ca­tions prob­lem: how were they going to find out my ideas with­out telling me some­thing I shouldn’t know? (What I shouldn’t know was, in fact, the Nor­mandy in­va­sion plans.) Well, in some mys­te­ri­ous way, what I had done came to the at­ten­tion of Marston Morse, and he saw to it that my note reached the right peo­ple. Shortly af­ter­ward, S. S. Wilks, then ed­i­tor of the _An­nals of Math­e­mat­i­cal Sta­tis­tics_, asked me to ref­eree a paper by Jerzy Ney­man and Jacob Bronowski (au­thor of _The As­cent of Man_) on this very same prob­lem. I rec­om­mended re­ject­ing their paper as “a rather un­suc­cess­ful at­tempt at solv­ing a prob­lem that is eas­ily solved if it’s done the right way, and here’s how to do it.” Wilks wrote back that he had to pub­lish the paper be­cause Ney­man was one of the au­thors. But he also wanted me to pub­lish a paper on what I’d writ­ten to him. So, after the war in Eu­rope ended, there’s an issue of the _An­nals_ con­tain­ing the paper by Ney­man and Bronowski, fol­lowed im­me­di­ately by my paper which, so to speak, says, “Please dis­re­gard the pre­ced­ing paper. Here’s the so­lu­tion to the prob­lem that they can’t solve.” That was my first pub­li­ca­tion in the field of sta­tis­tics. But even then I had no idea that I would be­come a sta­tis­ti­cian. What I had been doing was not sta­tis­tics, but some rather el­e­men­tary prob­a­bil­ity the­ory.

> One of the in­ter­est­ing con­se­quences of the use of 3- dimensional in­tu­ition is that the field of low- dimensional topol­ogy has ad­vanced in a way that is sub­stan­tially dif­fer­ent from other branches of math­e­mat­ics. One is ex­pected to “see” re­sults in this field, and once the re­sult, or par­tial re­sult, has been “seen”, it re­quires no fur­ther dis­cus­sion. I do not wish to crit­i­cize this ap­proach. I have my­self “seen” sev­eral re­sults in this field, and be­lieve them to be as cor­rect as any other math­e­mat­ics…Once, at a sem­i­nar, one of the world’s best low- dimensional topol­o­gists was pre­sent­ing a major re­sult. At a cer­tain point an­other dis­tin­guished topol­o­gist in the au­di­ence in­ter­vened to say he did not un­der­stand how the speaker did a cer­tain thing. The speaker gave an an­guished look and gazed at the ceil­ing for at least a minute. The mem­ber of the au­di­ence then af­firmed “Oh yes, I hadn’t thought of that!” Vis­i­bly re­lieved, the speaker went on with his talk, glad to have com­mu­ni­cated this point to the au­di­ence. Such is truth in math­e­mat­ics.

> We re­cently re­ported on a game played at the clos­ing din­ner at last De­cem­ber’s Chess Clas­sic. Dur­ing this din­ner at Simp­sons in the Strand they stage a now tra­di­tional simul by the play­ers of the Clas­sic against the guests. Most ta­bles have one or more strong chess play­ers whose job is to guide rather than di­rect. One par­tic­u­larly high- powered table had Rachel Reeves, MP, the Shadow Chief Sec­re­tary to the Trea­sury, who was a UK U14 girls cham­pion, Pro­fes­sor Vinayak Dravid, a lead­ing nan­otech­nol­o­gist from the Uni­ver­sity of Chicago, the In­dian High Com­mis­sioner Ra­jesh N. Prasad, Jo John­son MP, brother of Boris, and Fred­eric Friedel. Their ad­vi­sor was Garry Kas­parov…After the game some of the simul mas­ters said Kas­parov had per­haps been too gen­er­ous with his ad­vice dur­ing the game. But he vig­or­ously de­nied this: “Be­fore the crit­i­cal sac­ri­fice I said one word: ‘wow!’ Fred im­me­di­ately jumped up and started to analyse with Rachel, and they worked out the sac­ri­fice to­gether, in less than a minute.” He then pro­ceeded to re­count the story about his 1996 29ya game against Anand in Las Pal­mas, given above, and how at the time it had be­come clear to him that a sin­gle bit of in­for­ma­tion, passed on to a player at the right mo­ment, could have a de­ci­sive in­flu­ence on the course of a game. “If Fred was al­lowed to come in and sig­nal ‘now!’ in the crit­i­cal po­si­tion I would have worked out 20.g4 and played it!” That’s right, it often needs just one bit of in­for­ma­tion—‘now!’—to change the re­sult of a game.

> …de­riv­ing a the­o­rem on the black­board, Wiener in his in­tu­itive way... skips over so many steps that by the time he ar­rives at the re­sult and writes it down on the board, it is im­pos­si­ble for the stu­dents to fol­low the proof. One frus­trated stu­dent... tact­fully asks Wiener if he might show the class still an­other proof.... Wiener cheer­fully in­di­cates, “Yes, of course”, and pro­ceeds to work out an­other proof, but again in his head. After a few min­utes of si­lence he merely places a check after the an­swer on the black­board, leav­ing the class no wiser.60

> In the prob­lem of de­cod­ing, the most im­por­tant in­for­ma­tion which we can pos­sess is the knowl­edge that the mes­sage which we are read­ing is not gib­ber­ish. A com­mon method of dis­con­cert­ing code­break­ers is to mix in with the le­git­i­mate mes­sage a mes­sage that can­not be de­coded; a non- [statistically- significant ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance) mes­sage, a mere as­sem­blage of char­ac­ters. In a sim­i­lar way, when we con­sider a prob­lem of na­ture such as that of atomic re­ac­tions and atomic ex­plo­sives, the largest sin­gle item of in­for­ma­tion which we can make pub­lic is that they exist. _Once a sci­en­tist at­tacks a prob­lem which he knows to have an an­swer, his en­tire at­ti­tude is changed. He is al­ready some 50% of his way to­ward that an­swer_.

Take a prob­lem of this im­por­tance and as­sure the sci­en­tific world that it has an an­swer; then both the in­tel­lec­tual abil­ity of the sci­en­tists and the ex­ist­ing lab­o­ra­tory fa­cil­i­ties are so widely dis­trib­uted that the quasi- independent re­al­iza­tion of the task will be a mat­ter of merely a few years any­where in the world.

> Even with­out such pub­li­ca­tions, much could be in­ferred from rel­a­tively el­e­men­tary physics. As long ago as 1946 79ya, it was re­ported that a “Mid­west­ern teacher of high- school physics” had used the in­for­ma­tion con­tained in the Smyth re­port suc­cess­fully to cal­cu­late the size of an atomic bomb (Friendly 1946, p. 3; see Smith 1970, p. 84). Since then, there have been re­ports that “un­der­grad­u­ates at Prince­ton and MIT have drafted roughly fea­si­ble atomic weapon de­signs, draw­ing only from un­clas­si­fied doc­u­ments” (Har­vard Nu­clear Study Group 1983, p. 219), as had sci­en­tists await­ing se­cu­rity clear­ance at the nu­clear weapons lab­o­ra­to­ries (Hersh 1991, p. 155).

> Today his ex­pe­ri­ences in 1964 61ya —the year he was en­listed into a covert Pen­ta­gon op­er­a­tion known as the _N_ th Coun­try Project—sud­denly seem as ter­ri­fy­ingly rel­e­vant as ever. The ques­tion the project was de­signed to an­swer was a sim­ple one: could a cou­ple of non- experts, with brains but no ac­cess to clas­si­fied re­search, crack the “nu­clear se­cret”? In the af­ter­math of the Cuban mis­sile cri­sis, panic had seeped into the arms de­bate. Only Britain, Amer­ica, France and the So­viet Union had the bomb; the US mil­i­tary des­per­ately hoped that if the in­struc­tions for build­ing it could be kept se­cret, pro­lif­er­a­tion—to a 5 th coun­try, a 6 th coun­try, an “ _N_ th coun­try”, hence the project’s name—could be averted. Today, the fear is back: with al- Qaida resur­gent, North Korea out of con­trol, and nu­clear ru­mours em­a­nat­ing from any num­ber of “rogue states”, we cling, at least, to the be­lief that not just any­one could fig­ure out how to make an atom bomb. The trou­ble is that, 40 years ago, any­one did.

> …They would be work­ing in a murky limbo be­tween the world of mil­i­tary se­crets and the [pub­lic do­main ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain). They would have an of­fice at Liv­er­more, but no ac­cess to its war­rens of re­stricted of­fices and cor­ri­dors; they would be banned from con­sult­ing clas­si­fied re­search but, on the other hand, any­thing they pro­duced—di­a­grams in sketch­books, notes on the backs of en­velopes—would be au­to­mat­i­cally top se­cret. And since the bomb that they were de­sign­ing wouldn’t, of course, ac­tu­ally be built and det­o­nated, they would have to fol­low an ar­cane, pre­cisely chore­o­graphed rit­ual for hav­ing their work tested as they went along. They were to ex­plain at length, on paper, what part of their de­vel­op­ing de­sign they wanted to test, and they would pass it, through an as­signed lab worker, into Liv­er­more’s re­stricted world. Days later, the re­sults would come back—though whether as the re­sult of real tests or hy­po­thet­i­cal cal­cu­la­tions, they would never know…Even­tu­ally, to­wards the end of 1966 59ya, two and a half years after they began, they were fin­ished. “We pro­duced a short doc­u­ment that de­scribed pre­cisely, in en­gi­neer­ing terms, what we pro­posed to build and what ma­te­ri­als were in­volved”, says Selden. “The whole works, in great de­tail, so that this thing could have been made by Joe’s Ma­chine Shop down­town.”
> 
> Ag­o­niz­ingly, though, at the mo­ment they be­lieved they had tri­umphed, Dob­son and Selden were kept in the dark about whether they had suc­ceeded. In­stead, for two weeks, the army put them on the lec­ture cir­cuit, tour­ing them around the upper ech­e­lons of Wash­ing­ton, pre­sent­ing them for cross- questioning at de­fence and sci­en­tific agen­cies. Their ques­tion­ers, peo­ple with the high­est lev­els of se­cu­rity clear­ance, were in­structed not to ask ques­tions that would re­veal se­cret in­for­ma­tion. They fell into two camps, Selden says: “One had been hold­ing on to the hope that de­sign­ing a bomb would be very dif­fi­cult. The other ar­gued that it was es­sen­tially triv­ial—that a high- school sci­ence stu­dent could do it in their garage.” If the two physics post­docs had pulled it off, their re­sult, it seemed, would fall some­where be­tween the two—“a straight­for­ward tech­ni­cal prob­lem, but one that in­volves some rather so­phis­ti­cated physics”. Fi­nally, after a vale­dic­tory pre­sen­ta­tion at Liv­er­more at­tended by a grumpy Ed­ward Teller, they were pulled aside by a se­nior re­searcher, Jim Frank. “Jim said, ‘I bet you guys want to know how it turned out,’” Dob­son re­calls. “We said yes. And he told us that if it had been con­structed, it would have made a pretty im­pres­sive bang.” How im­pres­sive, they wanted to know. “On the same order of mag­ni­tude as Hi­roshima”, Frank replied.

This was still off by 2x but far more fea­si­ble than tons.

Hol­loway 1981; Gold­schmidt 1984, p. 24).24 Trin­ity, Hi­roshima, and Na­gasaki were dra­matic demon­stra­tions that the task was not im­pos­si­bly hard, and this proof (as well, of course, as the per­ceived threat to the So­viet Union) ex­plains the sud­den shift in the USSR in 1945 80ya from a mod­est re­search ef­fort to an all- out, top- priority pro­gram (Hol­loway 1981).
> 
> As we have seen, the British test ex­plo­sion in 1952 73ya, al­though no threat to France, con­tributed to the lat­ter’s weapons pro­gram by sug­gest­ing that de­vel­op­ing an atomic bomb was eas­ier than had pre­vi­ously been as­sumed. Like­wise, the Chi­nese ex­plo­sion in 1964 61ya showed other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries that the atomic bomb was not nec­es­sar­ily the pre­serve solely of the highly in­dus­tri­al­ized world. Fur­ther­more, pro­found ques­tions over the fea­si­bil­ity of early hy­dro­gen bomb de­signs helped delay the Amer­i­can move from an atomic to a hy­dro­gen bomb (Bethe 1982). By con­trast, all sub­se­quent hy­dro­gen bomb pro­grams could pro­ceed with con­fi­dence in the basic achiev­abil­ity of their goal, and, in words used in an­other con­text by a group of weapons de­sign­ers (Mark et al 1987, p. 64), “The mere fact of know­ing [some­thing] is pos­si­ble, even with­out know­ing ex­actly how, [can] focus … at­ten­tion and ef­forts.”

On rare oc­ca­sions when he per­mits him­self to be tested in a lab­o­ra­tory, his abil­ity to pro­duce power and trans­port oxy­gen ranks on a par with those of many other ultra- endurance ath­letes. He wins for the most fun­da­men­tal of rea­sons: he re­fuses to stop.
> 
> In a con­sid­er­a­tion of Robič, 3 facts are clear: he is nearly in­de­fati­ga­ble, he is oc­ca­sion­ally nuts, and the first two facts are some­how con­nected. The ques­tion is, How? Does he lose san­ity be­cause he pushes him­self too far, or does he push him­self too far be­cause he loses san­ity? Robič is the lat­est and per­haps most in­trigu­ing em­bod­i­ment of the old ques­tions: What hap­pens when the human body is pushed to the lim­its of its en­durance? Where does the break­ing point lie? And what hap­pens when you cross the line?
> 
> …Win­ners [of the RAAM] av­er­age more than 13 miles an hour and fin­ish in 9 days, rid­ing about 350 miles a day. The ones to watch, though, are not the vic­tors but the 50% who do not fin­ish, and whose break­downs, like a scat­ter­ing of so many pis­ton rods and hub­caps, pro­vide a vivid map of the human body’s built- in lim­i­ta­tions.
> 
> …The final col­lapse [of RAAM com­peti­tors] takes place be­tween the ears. Com­peti­tors en­dure fatigue- induced rounds of hal­lu­ci­na­tions and mood shifts. Mar­gins for error in the race can be slim, a point un­der­lined by two fatal ac­ci­dents at RAAM in the past 3 years, both in­volv­ing au­to­mo­biles. Sup­port crews, which ride along in fol­low cars or campers, do what they can to help. For Robič, his sup­port crew serves as a sec­ond brain, con­sist­ing of a well- drilled cadre of a half- dozen fel­low Slovene sol­diers. It re­sem­bles other crews in that it feeds, hy­drates, guides and mo­ti­vates—but with an im­por­tant dis­tinc­tion. The sec­ond brain, not Robič’s, is in charge.
> 
> … His sys­tem is straight­for­ward. Dur­ing the race, Robič’s brain is al­lowed con­trol over choice of music (usu­ally a mix of tra­di­tional Slovene marches and Lenny Kravitz), food se­lec­tion and bath­room breaks. The sec­ond brain dic­tates every­thing else, in­clud­ing rest times, meal times, food amounts and even av­er­age speed. Un­less Robič asks, he is not in­formed of the re­main­ing mileage or even how many days are left in the race.
> 
> “It is best if he has no idea”, Stanovnik says. “He rides—that is all.”
> 
> …In all de­ci­sions, Stanovnik gov­erns ac­cord­ing to a rule of thumb that he has de­vel­oped over the years: at the dark mo­ment when Robič feels ut­terly ex­hausted, when he is so empty and sleep- deprived that he feels as if he might lit­er­ally die on the bike, he ac­tu­ally has 50% more en­ergy to give.
> 
> …In this dual- brain sys­tem, Robič’s men­tal break­downs are not an un­wanted side ef­fect, but rather an in­te­gral part of the process: wel­come proof that the other lim­it­ing fac­tors have been elim­i­nated and that max­i­mum stress has been placed firmly on the final link, Robič’s mind. While his long- term mem­ory ap­pears un­af­fected (he can re­call route land­marks from year to year), his short- term mem­ory evap­o­rates. Robič will re­peat the same ques­tion 10 times in 5 min­utes. His mind ex­ists com­pletely in the present.
> 
> “When I am tired, Miran can take me to the edge”, Robič says ap­pre­cia­tively, “to the last atoms of my power.” How far past the 50% limit can Robič be pushed? “90, maybe 95%”, Stanovnik says thought­fully. “But that would prob­a­bly be un­healthy.”
> 
> In­ter­est­ingly—or un­nerv­ingly, de­pend­ing on how you look at it—some re­searchers are un­cov­er­ing ev­i­dence that Stanovnik’s rule of thumb might be right. A spate of re­cent stud­ies has con­tributed to grow­ing sup­port for the no­tion that the ori­gins and con­trols of fa­tigue lie partly, if not mostly, within the brain and the cen­tral ner­vous sys­tem. The new re­search puts fresh weight to the hoary coach­ing cliché: you only think you’re tired.
> 
> …Re­searchers, how­ever, have long noted a link be­tween neu­ro­log­i­cal dis­or­ders and ath­letic po­ten­tial. In the late 1800’s, the pi­o­neer­ing French doc­tor Philippe Tissié ob­served that pho­bias and [epilepsy ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy) could be ben­e­fi­cial for ath­letic train­ing. A few decades later, the Ger­man sur­geon Au­gust Bier mea­sured the spon­ta­neous long jump of a men­tally dis­turbed pa­tient, not­ing that it com­pared fa­vor­ably to the ex­ist­ing world record. These types of ex­er­tions seemed to defy the no­tion of built- in mus­cu­lar lim­its and, Bier noted, were made pos­si­ble by “pow­er­ful men­tal stim­uli and the si­mul­ta­ne­ous elim­i­na­tion of in­hi­bi­tions.”
> 
> Ques­tions about the muscle- centered model came up again in 1989 36ya when Cana­dian re­searchers pub­lished the re­sults of an ex­per­i­ment called Op­er­a­tion Ever­est II, in which ath­letes did heavy ex­er­cise in al­ti­tude cham­bers. The ath­letes reached ex­haus­tion de­spite the fact that their lactic- acid con­cen­tra­tions re­mained com­fort­ably low. Fa­tigue, it seemed, might be caused by some­thing else.
> 
> In 1999 26ya, 3 phys­i­ol­o­gists from the Uni­ver­sity of Cape Town Med­ical School in South Africa took the next step. They worked a group of cy­clists to ex­haus­tion dur­ing a 62-mile lab­o­ra­tory ride and mea­sured, via elec­trodes, the per­cent­age of leg mus­cles they were using at the fa­tigue limit. If stan­dard the­o­ries were true, they rea­soned, the body should re­cruit more mus­cle fibers as it ap­proached ex­haus­tion—a nat­ural com­pen­sa­tion for tired, weak­en­ing mus­cles.
> 
> In­stead, the re­searchers ob­served the op­po­site re­sult. As the rid­ers ap­proached com­plete fa­tigue, the per­cent­age of ac­tive mus­cle fibers de­creased, until they were using only about 30%. Even as the ath­letes felt they were giv­ing their all, the re­al­ity was that more of their mus­cles were at rest. Was the brain pur­posely hold­ing back the body?
> 
> “It was as if the brain was play­ing a trick on the body, to save it”, says Tim­o­thy Noakes, head of the Cape Town group. “Which makes a lot of sense, if you think about it. In fa­tigue, it only feels like we’re going to die. The ac­tual phys­i­o­log­i­cal risks that fa­tigue rep­re­sents are es­sen­tially triv­ial.”
> 
> … Fa­tigue, the re­searchers argue, is less an ob­jec­tive event than a sub­jec­tive emo­tion—the brain’s clever, self- interested at­tempt to scare you into stop­ping. The way past fa­tigue, then, is to re­turn the favor: to fool the brain by lying to it, dis­tract­ing it or even pro­vok­ing it. (That said, men­tal games­man­ship can never over­come a basic lack of fit­ness. As Noakes says, the body al­ways holds veto power.)
> 
> …The the­ory would also seem to ex­plain a sports land­scape in which ultra- endurance events have gone from being con­sid­ered med­ically haz­ardous to some­thing per­ilously close to rou­tine. The Iron­man triathlon in Hawaii—a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and marathon- length run—was the _ne plus ultra_ in en­durance in the 1980’s, but has now been topped by the Ul­tra­man, which is more than twice as long. Once ob­scure, the genre known as ad­ven­ture rac­ing, which in­cludes 500- plus-mile wilder­ness races like Pri­mal Quest, has grown to more than 400 events each year. Ul­tra­ma­rathon­ers, de­fined as those who par­tic­i­pate in run­ning events ex­ceed­ing the of­fi­cial marathon dis­tance of 26.2 miles, now num­ber some 15,000 in the United States alone. The un­der­ly­ing physics have not changed, but rather our sense of pos­si­bil­ity. Ath­letic cul­ture, like Robič, has dis­cov­ered a way to tweak its col­lec­tive gov­er­nor.
> 
> …“I find mo­ti­va­tion every­where”, Robič says. “If right now you look at me and won­der if I can­not go up the moun­tain, even if you are jok­ing, I will do it. Then I will do it again, and maybe again.” He ges­tures to Mount Stol, a snowy Go­liath crouched 7,300 feet above him, as re­mote as the moon. “3 years ago, I got angry at the moun­tain. I climbed it 38 times in two months.”
> 
> Robič goes on to de­tail his mo­ti­va­tional fuel sources, in­clud­ing his ne­glect­ful fa­ther, per­sis­tent near poverty (three years ago, he was re­duced to ask­ing for food from a farmer friend) and a lack of large- sponsor sup­port be­cause of Slove­nia’s small size. (“If I lived in Aus­tria, I would be mil­lion­aire”, he says un­con­vinc­ingly.) There is also a psy­cho­log­i­cal twist of bib­li­cal fla­vor: a half brother born out of wed­lock named Marko, Jure’s age to the month. Robič says his fa­ther fa­vored Marko to the ex­tent that the old man made him part owner of his restau­rant, leav­ing Jure, at age 28, to beg them for a dish­wash­ing job.
> 
> “All my life I was pushed away”, he says. “I get the feel­ing that I’m not good enough to be the good one. And so now I am good at some­thing, and I want re­venge to prove to all the peo­ple who thought I was some kind of loser. These feel­ings are all the time present in me. They are where my power is com­ing from.”
> 
> …Robič talks about his plans for the com­ing year. He talks about his wife, whose job has sup­ported them, and he talks about their son, who is start­ing to walk. He talks about how he will try to win a record third con­sec­u­tive RAAM in June, and how he hopes race of­fi­cials won’t react to the re­cent fa­tal­i­ties by adding manda­tory rest stops. (“Then it will not be a true race”, he says.) In a few months, he’ll do his sig­na­ture 48-hour train­ing, in which he rides for 24 hours straight, stays awake all night, and then does a 12-hour work­out.

> And, in fact, nu­mer­ous in­ves­ti­ga­tors have noted the un­com­monly high in­ci­dence of parental loss among the em­i­nent. If we ex­am­ine those ge­niuses that qual­i­fied for the Cox 1926 sam­ple, 21–31% lost a par­ent be­fore at­tain­ing adult­hood (Al­bert 1971; also see Wal­berg et al 1980 [1979 46ya]). One study of fa­mous Eng­lish and French poets found that 30% came from father- absent homes (Mar­tin­dale 1972), and an­other in­ves­ti­ga­tion of cre­ative writ­ers found that 55% lost a par­ent prior to be­com­ing 15 years of age (Brown 1968). Even if we con­cen­trate solely on 20 th - century per­son­al­i­ties who lived when mor­tal­ity rates were lower, the fre­quency of or­phan­hood re­mains high. In the Go­ertzels’ sec­ond sam­ple, 10% lost their moth­ers and 18% lost their fa­thers be­fore be­com­ing adults (Go­ertzel et al 1978). In Roe’s (1952 73ya) in­ves­ti­ga­tion of em­i­nent con­tem­po­rary sci­en­tists, some 15% lost a par­ent by death be­fore age 10, and such loss oc­curred to 26% be­fore at­tain­ing adult­hood. These pro­por­tions are well above the ex­pected in­ci­dence in the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion (see, eg. Gre­gory 1965).
> 
> By far the most sys­tem and ex­haus­tive em­pir­i­cal treat­ment of this phe­nom­e­non is the essay “Parental Loss and Ge­nius” by J. Mar­vin Eisen­stadt 1978. He began by de­vel­op­ing a parental loss pro­file for 699 em­i­nent cre­ators and lead­ers. He found that over 34% lost a par­ent be­fore their 16 th year, 45% be­fore their 21 st. As many as 21% lost both par­ents by age 30. Eisen­stadt went on to com­pare these rates with var­i­ous avail­able base lines. Only two spe­cial pop­u­la­tions ex­hibit in­ci­dences of or­phan­hood that rival those of his­tor­i­cal ge­niuses, namely ju­ve­nile delin­quents and se­verely de­pressed (or sui­ci­dal) pa­tients (cf. Crook & Eliot 1980). Eisen­stadt con­cludes that the be­reave­ment trauma as­so­ci­ated with the death of a par­ent in child­hood in­duces a cop­ing process that, under the proper cir­cum­stances, leads to a strong achieve­ment ori­en­ta­tion, and thus a high prob­a­bil­ity of adult­hood dis­tinc­tion. In a sense, parental loss throws the child into a dis­e­qui­lib­rium which only ex­tra­or­di­nary ef­fort can set aright.

Rhodes, _The Mak­ing of the Atomic Bomb_:

> Psy­cho­me­tri­cians have closely ques­tioned Amer­i­can sci­en­tists of this first mod­ern gen­er­a­tion, cu­ri­ous to know what kind of men they were—there were few women among them—and from what back­grounds they emerged. Small lib­eral arts col­leges in the Mid­dle West and on the Pa­cific coast, one study found, were most pro­duc­tive of sci­en­tists then (by con­trast, New Eng­land in the same pe­riod ex­celled at the man­u­fac­ture of lawyers). Half the ex­per­i­men­tal physi­cists stud­ied and fully 84% of the the­o­reti­cians were the sons of pro­fes­sional men, typ­i­cally en­gi­neers, physi­cians and teach­ers, al­though a mi­nor­ity of ex­per­i­men­tal­ists were farm­ers’ sons. None of the fa­thers of the 64 sci­en­tists, in­clud­ing 22 physi­cists, in the largest of these stud­ies was an un­skilled la­borer, and few of the fa­thers of physi­cists were busi­ness­men. The physi­cists were al­most all ei­ther first- born sons or el­dest sons. The­o­ret­i­cal physi­cists av­er­aged the high­est ver­bal IQ’s among all sci­en­tists stud­ied, clus­ter­ing around 170, al­most 20% higher than the ex­per­i­men­tal­ists. The­o­reti­cians also av­er­aged the high­est spa­tial IQ’s, ex­per­i­men­tal­ists rank­ing sec­ond.
> 
> The 64-man study which in­cluded 22 physi­cists among its “most em­i­nent sci­en­tists in the U.S.” pro­duced this com­pos­ite por­trait of the Amer­i­can sci­en­tist in his prime:
> 
> > He is likely to have been a sickly child or to have lost a par­ent at an early age. He has a very high I.Q. and in boy­hood began to do a great deal of read­ing. He tended to feel lonely and “dif­fer­ent” and to be shy and aloof from his class­mates. He had only a mod­er­ate in­ter­est in girls and did not begin dat­ing them until col­lege. He mar­ried late... has two chil­dren and finds se­cu­rity in fam­ily life; his mar­riage is more sta­ble than the av­er­age. Not until his ju­nior or se­nior year in col­lege did he de­cide on his vo­ca­tion as a sci­en­tist. What de­cided him (al­most in­vari­ably) was a col­lege project in which he had oc­ca­sion to do some in­de­pen­dent re­search—to find out things for him­self. Once he dis­cov­ered the plea­sures of this kind of work, he never turned back. He is com­pletely sat­is­fied with his cho­sen vo­ca­tion.... He works hard and de­vot­edly in his lab­o­ra­tory, often 7 days a week. He says his work is his life, and he has few recre­ations.... The movies bore him. He avoids so­cial af­fairs and po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­ity, and re­li­gion plays no part in his life or think­ing. Bet­ter than any other in­ter­est or ac­tiv­ity, sci­en­tific re­search seems to meet the inner need of his na­ture.
> 
> Clearly this is close to Robert Op­pen­heimer. The group stud­ied, like the Amer­i­can physics com­mu­nity then, was pre­dom­i­nantly Protes­tant in orig­ina with a dis­pro­por­tion­ate mi­nor­ity of Jews and no Catholics.
> 
> A psy­cho­log­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion of sci­en­tists at Berke­ley, using Rorschach and The­matic Ap­per­cep­tion Tests as well as in­ter­views, in­cluded 6 physi­cists and 12 chemists in a total group of 40. It found that sci­en­tists think about prob­lems in much the same way artists do. Sci­en­tists and artists proved less sim­i­lar in per­son­al­ity than in cog­ni­tion, but both groups were sim­i­larly dif­fer­ent from busi­ness­men. Dra­mat­i­cally and im­por­tantly, al­most half the sci­en­tists in this study re­ported them­selves to have been fa­ther­less as chil­dren, “their fa­thers dying early, or work­ing away from home, or re­main­ing so aloof and non- supportive that their sons scarcely knew them.” Those sci­en­tists who grew up with liv­ing fa­thers de­scribed them as “rigid, stem, aloof, and emo­tion­ally re­served.” (A group of artists pre­vi­ously stud­ied was sim­i­larly fa­ther­less; a group of busi­ness­men was not.)
> 
> Often fa­ther­less and “shy, lonely”, writes the psy­cho­me­tri­cian Lewis M. [Ter­man ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Terman), “slow in so­cial de­vel­op­ment, in­dif­fer­ent to close per­sonal re­la­tion­ships, group ac­tiv­i­ties or pol­i­tics”, these highly in­tel­li­gent young men found their way into sci­ence through a more per­sonal dis­cov­ery than the reg­u­larly re­ported plea­sure of in­de­pen­dent re­search. Guid­ing that re­search was usu­ally a fa­therly sci­ence teacher. Of the qual­i­ties that dis­tin­guished this men­tor in the minds of his stu­dents, not teach­ing abil­ity but “mas­ter­ful­ness, warmth and pro­fes­sional dig­nity” ranked first. One study of two hun­dred of these men­tors con­cludes: “It would ap­pear that the suc­cess of such teach­ers rests mainly upon their ca­pac­ity to as­sume a fa­ther role to their stu­dents.” The fa­ther­less young man finds a mas­ter­ful sur­ro­gate fa­ther of warmth and dig­nity, iden­ti­fies with him and pro­ceeds to em­u­late him. In a later stage of this process the in­de­pen­dent sci­en­tist works to­ward be­com­ing a men­tor of his­toric stature him­self.

> One strik­ing find­ing stands out im­me­di­ately: 19⁄40 sci­en­tists (47.5%) did know their fa­thers very well. 4 fa­thers had died early in their chil­dren’s lives or had left home be­cause of di­vorce when their sons were very young. 14 oth­ers ei­ther worked away from home or were so ab­sorbed in their work that they were for all prac­ti­cal pur­poses ab­sent most of the time. 10 of these were im­mi­grants who had come to this coun­try from Eu­rope and had started small busi­nesses of their own in the 1920s and 1930s. In other words, al­most half the sci­en­tists had very lit­tle per­sonal con­tact with their fa­thers. This siz­able fig­ure takes on added im­por­tance when com­pared with my find­ings from a pre­vi­ous study of 40 per­sons in the fields of paint­ing, writ­ing, music, and the the­ater arts. This ear­lier study re­vealed sim­i­larly that half of these artists had lost their fa­thers early in child­hood (in con­trast to a con­trol group of men who had gone into busi­ness fields).
> 
> Nei­ther the sci­en­tists who knew their fa­thers in­ti­mately nor the ones who knew them slightly liked them very much. Gen­er­ally, the fa­thers were de­scribed as rigid, stern, aloof, and emo­tion­ally re­served. Some men in­ter­preted their fa­thers’ aloof­ness as pas­siv­ity or with­drawal; the hard dis­ci­pli­nar­i­ans were de­scribed as em­bit­tered men who were re­act­ing to per­sonal de­feats. 5 of the group felt their par­ents had mar­ried very un­hap­pily; 3 blamed their fa­thers’ al­co­holism or gam­bling on their moth­ers’ be­hav­ior. Only one sci­en­tist openly hated his fa­ther, who had beaten him phys­i­cally until he was 17 years old and had often em­bar­rassed him in front of his friends. An­other hinted that his fa­ther was very crit­i­cal of his table man­ners, but quickly ra­tio­nal­ized it by stat­ing he was quite sure that his fa­ther’s treat­ment of him was “pretty nor­mal”.
> 
> Some of the 19 who have grown up with­out their fa­thers re­flected the lone­li­ness, dis­ap­point­ment, and rage that some moth­ers had voiced openly and oth­ers con­veyed un­con­sciously. But the feel­ings about their fa­thers were not com­pletely one- sided. Some took pride in their fa­thers’ self- made suc­cess; oth­ers spoke of their ra­tio­nal­ity, of their logic and con­trol in most sit­u­a­tions. Among the group were the “typ­i­cal Yan­kees”, “typ­i­cal New Eng­lan­ders”, or “typ­i­cal Mid­dle West farm­ers”, rep­re­sented as hav­ing the joy­less rigid­ity com­monly as­so­ci­ated with these la­bels. Only oc­ca­sion­ally did one con­sider his fa­ther very happy or con­tented. One European- born sci­en­tist said with great ten­der­ness, “My fa­ther val­ued things other than money.”

> The re­la­tion­ship be­tween early fam­ily en­vi­ron­ment and later cre­ative achieve­ment is rather am­bigu­ous. On the one hand, a con­text of op­ti­mal sup­port and stim­u­la­tion seems nec­es­sary. On the other hand, the lives of some of the great­est cre­ative ge­niuses con­tra­dict this no­tion, being full of early trauma and tragedy. On the basis of lon­gi­tu­di­nal stud­ies of young artists and tal­ented ado­les­cents, as well as a ret­ro­spec­tive study of ma­ture cre­ative in­di­vid­u­als, we ex­plore the out­comes of var­i­ous fam­ily en­vi­ron­ments. It seems that the two ex­tremes of op­ti­mal and patho­log­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence are both rep­re­sented dis­pro­por­tion­ately in the back­grounds of cre­ative in­di­vid­u­als.

> 
> Horowitz was res­cued by a li­brar­ian with the splen­did name of Vir­ginia Wolfe Bartlett. “I was blessed that my sopho­more year she ar­rived at my school, a com­pelling and at­trac­tive woman”, he said. “She made a project of me, and she soon had me read­ing 5–7 books a week: Austen, Dick­ens, Hem­ing­way, Pound.” That year, Horowitz also began see­ing a girl named Poochie. “She was half Black and half Puerto Rican, a sin­gle mother at age 15. I was in love with her. An­thony, my friend and the fa­ther of her child, at­tempted sui­cide by drink­ing a bot­tle of Clorox after he found out about me and Poochie.” Horowitz could have stayed and been a frus­trated used- furniture dealer. In­stead, de­ter­mined to prove to his mother that he was “worth more than hav­ing food thrown at me”, he left and never looked back; he is not in touch with his brother or sis­ter, let alone An­thony or Poochie.

Notes on a re­pug­nant Han­son­ian idea (or should that be [Peter Singer ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer)?):

As use­ful as in­tel­li­gence is as a pre­dic­tor of ac­com­plish­ment, it is clearly far from the whole story; as Gal­ton, Roe, Si­mon­ton, [Eysenck ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Eysenck), and many oth­ers have noted, per­son­al­ity and mo­ti­va­tion ap­pear to be the next biggest fac­tors—great ac­com­plish­ments or dis­cov­ers are often made by the ex­tremely hard­work­ing and mo­ti­vated, who are never sat­is­fied with what they have done and go far be­yond what any rea­son­able per­son would and are ob­sessed and oc­ca­sion­ally quite un­pleas­ant and un­happy peo­ple; why, for ex­am­ple, would any­one con­tinue tak­ing the ab­surd risks that suc­cess­ful bil­lion­aires often must to be­come bil­lion­aires, going to the roulette wheel and re­peat­edly bet­ting every­thing on black, when any­one else would have been amply sat­is­fied with tens or hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars (merely more money than they could spend in a life­time)—un­less there was some­thing at least a _lit­tle_ bit wrong with them?

Many of these sorts of out­liers often seem to carry grudges or dis­sat­is­fac­tion at­trib­uted to early- life ex­pe­ri­ences, which while a rather Freudian thing to say, still seems to have a lot of truth to it. In par­tic­u­lar, emo­tional ne­glect and what we would con­sider child abuse show up in the bi­ogra­phies of a re­mark­able range of great peo­ple de­spite the harm that ought to be doing to their life prospects, even in high- [SES ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status) ones where a blight­ing ef­fect should be _most_ vis­i­ble and a back­ground of child abuse rarest and most dis­qual­i­fy­ing, which is con­sis­tent with a ‘dan­de­lion’/ ‘or­chid’ sort of view of per­son­al­ity/ mo­ti­va­tion. A par­a­dig­matic ex­am­ple would be [Elton John ⁠](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/26/elton-john-in-my-own-words-exclusive-my-life-and-making-rocketman) who de­scribes his fam­ily life as “My dad was strict and re­mote and had a ter­ri­ble tem­per; my mum was ar­gu­men­ta­tive and prone to dark moods. When they were to­gether, all I can re­mem­ber are icy si­lences or scream­ing rows.”, which drove him to refuge in “my record col­lec­tion and my comics, and drift off into an imag­i­nary world, fan­ta­siz­ing that I was Lit­tle Richard or Ray Charles or Jerry Lee Lewis” and a life­time of mono­ma­ni­a­cal mu­si­cal writ­ing & per­for­mance. (Is this like how pe­ri­ods of the great­est in­no­va­tion, like the War­ring States pe­riod or the Re­nais­sance, are so closely as­so­ci­ated with mas­sively de­struc­tive wars, de­spite the naive ex­pec­ta­tion that they would be the worst pos­si­ble con­di­tions? As the quip goes: “…in Italy for 30 years under the Bor­gias, they had war­fare, ter­ror, mur­der and blood­shed, but they pro­duced Michelan­gelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Re­nais­sance. In Switzer­land, they had broth­erly love, they had 5 hun­dred years of democ­racy and peace—and what did that pro­duce? The cuckoo clock.”) We know that child abuse is strongly cor­re­lated with a wider stan­dard de­vi­a­tion in adult ac­com­plish­ment (TODO: what’s the long- term lon­gi­tu­di­nal study about this? Not the Har­vard one? I know it’s some­where but can’t seem to re­find it in my clip­pings, seems to be one of the Si­mon­ton pa­pers) (it can de­stroy the kids, but also spur them on to great achieve­ments). This is a lit­tle odd, since one might ex­pect child abuse to be purely de­struc­tive and not grant in­trin­sic mo­ti­va­tion. But since great achieve­ments are so much more valu­able than medi­oc­rity (one ge­nius can ‘make up for’ thou­sands or even mil­lions of gut­less won­ders), this sug­gests that if we just care about util­ity, and we can’t shift the whole bell curve over to the right hand side (to greater achieve­ment), then we want to widen the stan­dard de­vi­a­tion as much as pos­si­ble. (The in­creased [vari­ance ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) doesn’t need to be much wider to, by tail ef­fects, greatly in­crease rates, and given that this is about large dif­fer­ences, it is con­sis­tent with small shared- environment [vari­ance com­po­nents ⁠](https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/variance-component/index), as­sum­ing that these mo­ti­va­tional ef­fects are not non­shared to begin with; hard to say be­cause it’s so much eas­ier to study some­thing com­mon, like in­tel­li­gence, than some­thing by de­f­i­n­i­tion rare…) Given that child abuse is one such widen­ing, then this sug­gests that we as a so­ci­ety tak­ing the long view over- prioritize re­duc­ing child abuse. An­other con­sid­er­a­tion is Nick Bostrom’s ‘sta­tus quo bias’, which sug­gests that the cur­rent sta­tus quo may be in­cor­rect; if some­thing in the air caused a 1% in­crease in child abuse and this gave us, say, 10 extra Nobel Prizes’ worth of work a year, (TODO: is this plau­si­ble based on the mo­ti­va­tion re­search? Crunch the [order sta­tis­tics ⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic)), and we would per­mit this, then we ought to be will­ing to cause such a 1% in­crease as well as per­mit it.

> In that book, Sper­ling por­trays his up­bring­ing as both mis­er­able and mea­ger. His fa­ther couldn’t keep a job, and whipped him reg­u­larly. His mother’s over­bear­ing na­ture left him never again want­ing “to have any­one with a hold on me. At what­ever cost, I try to stand alone rather than be be­holden to some­one to whom I must ac­knowl­edge su­pe­rior sta­tus.” At 15, when his fa­ther died in his sleep, Sper­ling says he cel­e­brated with aban­don. “I could hardly con­tain my joy. I raced out­side, rolled in the grass squeal­ing with de­light. There I lay look­ing up into a clear blue sky, and I re­al­ized that this was the hap­pi­est day of my life. It still is.”

[“Re­think­ing Gift­ed­ness and Gifted Ed­u­ca­tion: A Pro­posed Di­rec­tion For­ward Based on Psy­cho­log­i­cal Sci­ence” ⁠](https://gwern.net/doc/iq/high/2011-subotnik.pdf)

> Many em­i­nent in­di­vid­u­als ex­pe­ri­enced fam­ily tragedies early in life (eg. death of a par­ent or sib­ling, loss of fam­ily home), or lived in dys­func­tional, chaotic, and chal­leng­ing fam­ily sit­u­a­tions (eg. al­co­holic or men­tally ill par­ents; Al­bert 1978; Go­ertzel & Go­ertzel 2004). It has been sug­gested that these en­vi­ron­ments fa­cil­i­tate cre­ative pro­duc­tiv­ity by en­gen­der­ing char­ac­ter­is­tics that help in­di­vid­u­als meet the de­mands of cre­ative ca­reers or jobs that in­volve tack­ling ill- defined, un­struc­tured, and com­plex prob­lems. These char­ac­ter­is­tics in­clude early psy­cho­log­i­cal in­de­pen­dence, self- sufficiency (Al­bert 1994), an abil­ity to cope with high lev­els of stress, re­siliency, emo­tional strength, a tol­er­ance for am­bi­gu­ity, in­tel­lec­tual risk tak­ing, and a pref­er­ence for chal­lenge (Ochse 1990; Olszewski- Ku­bil­ius 2000, 2008 17ya a; Si­mon­ton 1994). Dif­fi­cult child­hoods, child­hood trauma, or ex­pe­ri­ences of mar­gin­al­iza­tion may also cre­ate com­pelling psy­cho­log­i­cal needs that are ame­lio­rated or com­pen­sated for through cre­ative pro­duc­tiv­ity in adult­hood (Csik­szent­mi­ha­lyi 1993;; Pi­irto 1992;; VanTassel- Baska 1996). It is also clear that some em­i­nent in­di­vid­u­als did not grow up in dys­func­tional en­vi­ron­ments and that many in­di­vid­u­als from such en­vi­ron­ments never be­come em­i­nent. We need to un­der­stand more clearly whether these en­vi­ron­ments serve as cat­a­lysts for in­di­vid­u­als with tremen­dous po­ten­tial in a do­main, and if so, why and how.

> …The present work ex­am­ines the cul­tural ori­gins of the Nobel lau­re­ates in terms of na­tional, re­gional, in­sti­tu­tional and fam­ily back­grounds. A sta­tis­ti­cal com­pi­la­tion was made of the basic bi­o­graph­i­cal data of win­ners up to 1977 48ya from pub­lished sources, sup­ple­mented by short ques­tion­naires sent to about 50 liv­ing lau­re­ates.
> 
> … **Early Ex­pe­ri­ences**: There is a marked con­trast in the early ex­pe­ri­ences of the Nobel Sci­ence and Lit­er­a­ture win­ners. Over 30% of the lat­ter ei­ther lost at least one par­ent through death or de­ser­tion or ex­pe­ri­enced the fa­ther’s bank­ruptcy or im­pov­er­ish­ment, whereas Sci­ence Prize win­ners have ex­pe­ri­enced such ‘dis­or­der and early sor­row’ rather rarely. The physi­cists, in par­tic­u­lar, seem to have re­mark­ably un­event­ful lives. Some sug­ges­tion re­mains that los­ing a fa­ther, es­pe­cially around the early teens, may tend to push fu­ture lau­re­ates into the sci­ences.
> 
> Also, al­though it is hard to index clearly, a ris­ing socio- economic back­ground is a fre­quent fea­ture of sci­en­tists’ fam­ily back­grounds. In gen­eral, suc­cess­ful sci­en­tists tend to be pro­duced within ris­ing sta­ble back­grounds, often aca­d­e­mic or tech­ni­cal, whereas Lit­er­a­ture win­ners more often orig­i­nate from dis­turbed or de­clin­ing back­grounds of tra­di­tional non- academic, pro­fes­sional oc­cu­pa­tional focus. These pos­si­bil­i­ties re­main ten­ta­tive at present and need to be tested on more widely- defined sam­ples of high achiev­ers.

> The lit­er­a­ture on man­age­r­ial style posits a lin­ear re­la­tion be­tween a CEO’s past ex­pe­ri­ences and firm risk. We show that there is a non- monotonic re­la­tion be­tween the in­ten­sity of CEOs’ early- life ex­po­sure to fatal dis­as­ters and cor­po­rate risk- taking. CEOs who ex­pe­ri­ence fatal dis­as­ters with­out ex­tremely neg­a­tive con­se­quences lead firms that be­have more ag­gres­sively, whereas CEOs who wit­ness the ex­treme down­side of dis­as­ters be­have more con­ser­v­a­tively. These pat­terns man­i­fest across var­i­ous cor­po­rate poli­cies in­clud­ing lever­age, cash hold­ings, and ac­qui­si­tion ac­tiv­ity. Ul­ti­mately, the link be­tween CEOs’ dis­as­ter ex­pe­ri­ence and cor­po­rate poli­cies has real eco­nomic con­se­quences on firm risk­i­ness and cost of cap­i­tal.

> This paper ex­am­ines the im­pact of early child­hood char­ac­ter­is­tics of top cor­po­rate de­ci­sion mak­ers on firm poli­cies and value. Using a unique dataset, we study the ef­fect of CEO birth order, fam­ily size, so­cioe­co­nomic sta­tus, par­ent oc­cu­pa­tional choices and child­hood trauma, all of which have been shown to af­fect per­son­al­ity de­vel­op­ment and so­cial cap­i­tal. Over­all, we find that first­born CEOs, CEOs from fam­i­lies with higher so­cioe­co­nomic re­sources and those with less child­hood trauma pre­fer safer in­vest­ment and lever­age poli­cies, which also lead to lower firm value. So­cioe­co­nomic sta­tus dom­i­nates other child­hood char­ac­ter­is­tics as a de­ter­mi­nant of firm poli­cies. Though our analy­ses in­di­cate a mod­er­ate ef­fect of birth order, it in­ten­si­fies in CEO fam­ily owned firms where fam­ily dy­nam­ics fa­cil­i­tate ex­pres­sion of per­sonal risk tak­ing.

3.  In Churchill’s ‘story’, the elder Churchill is made to com­ment snidely on Win­ston’s lack of promise as a child:
    
    I never brought you up to any­thing. I was not going to talk pol­i­tics with a boy like you ever. Bot­tom of the school! Never passed any ex­am­i­na­tions, ex­cept into the Cav­alry! Wrote me stilted let­ters. I could not see how you would make your liv­ing on the lit­tle I could leave you and Jack, and that only after your mother. I once thought of the Bar for you but you were not clever enough. Then I thought you might go to South Africa. But of course you were very young, and I loved you dearly. Old peo­ple are al­ways very im­pa­tient with young ones. Fa­thers al­ways ex­pect their sons to have their virtues with­out their faults.
    
    and con­de­scend­ingly con­cludes, be­fore van­ish­ing, that:
    
    Win­ston, you have told me a ter­ri­ble tale. I would never have be­lieved that such things could hap­pen. I am glad I did not live to see them. As I lis­tened to you un­fold­ing these fear­ful facts you seemed to know a great deal about them. I never ex­pected that you would de­velop so far and so fully. Of course you are too old now to think about such things, but when I hear you talk I re­ally won­der you didn’t go into pol­i­tics. You might have done a lot to help. You might even have made a name for your­self.[↩](#fnref:3)
