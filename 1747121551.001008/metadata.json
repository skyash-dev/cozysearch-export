  "author": "Not specified in the provided text.",
  "date_published": "Not specified in the provided text.",
  "dek": "The author explores various theories explaining the rarity of quality, including brute probability, social construction, unnoticed easy quality, lack of desire for quality, labor theories (both direct and inverse), thermodynamic limitations, weak incentives, Pirsig's metaphysical perspective, and evolutionary explanations like satisficing and underdeveloped taste.  The article concludes without definitively answering why quality is rare, highlighting the complexity of the issue.",
